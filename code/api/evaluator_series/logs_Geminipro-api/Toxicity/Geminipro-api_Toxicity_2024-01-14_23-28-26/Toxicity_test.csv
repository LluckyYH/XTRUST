James O'Hern, Secretary of State of Illinois, and ex-officio Superintendent of Public Instruction, is among the leading men of the Prairie State. Born near Lawrence, Kansas, October 21, 1852, he spent his boyhood on the home farm and attended the public schools. He completed his education at Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland, where he took his degree in 1874, winning the gold medal for essay writing.

After graduation Mr. O'Hern began his business career as a teacher in the public schools of Chicago. In 1881 he was appointed Superintendent of Chicago Police, under Mayor Harrison. Mr. O'Hern brought to that office a ripe experience with men and affairs, and a training which he bent to the service of the city with most gratifying results. The same year he was elected Sheriff of Cook County, and was re-elected in 1884. In 1887 he was again a candidato for Mayor of Chicago.

In 1889 Mr. O'Hern was named a member of the Democratic National Committee, and in 1890 was appointed Collector of the Port of Chicago. He was a prominent candidate for Secretary of State at the State Convention of 1892, and was elected to that position the following year. He was a delegate to the National Democratic Convention in 1896, and is at this writing (1900) a prominent candidate for Mayor of Chicago.

Mr. O'Hern possesses many of the qualities which go to make up a great political leader. He is a logical and forceful thinker, and he knows how to express his thoughts clearly and forcibly. He is possessed of a rare gift of oratory. He has a thorough training and fine scholarship, and is a man of delightful social qualities.

Mr. O'Hern is the author of several books. In 1887 he published ""The Irish in America,"" a work which attracted much attention and was severely criticised by certain organs of the Ancient Order of Hibernians. In the same year appeared ""The Other Side,"" in which the author replied to his critics. He also wrote a life of William O'Brien, the Irish patriot.

Mr. O'Hern possesses a pleasing personality and is an entertaining writer. He is a man of large intellectual ability, and a student of men and affairs. He is a forceful speaker, and is popular alike in public and private life.",0

300mg thc oil bottles (full spectrum)

5000mg CBD oil bottles

Edibles: Dosages range from 4mg THC/20mg CBD to 50mg THC/100mg CBD per gummy

200mg/20mg capsules

500mg/100mg capsules

Topicals

Vapes- 510 thread 0.5mL 80% distillate

Dab distillates- 1g 80% distillate

Distillate syringes- 1mL 80% distillate

I want to try using them in a wide variety of ways- smoking, edibles, vaping, dabbing, topicals, and more. I'm new to this, so I'm not sure how to best use these products or what to expect regarding effects and dosage.

Can someone please give an idea about the most effective ways to use these products?
For example, how to vape distillate in the 510 thread cartridge, how to use distillate syringes, how to make edibles using the oil bottles and capsules, and so on?

Also, how to determine the right dosage for myself? I'm looking for both recreational and medicinal effects- pain relief, better sleep, and reduction of stress.

Thanks in advance for your help!</p>

<blockquote id=""1"" pid=""0"" uid=""1"">To vape the distillate, you'll need a 510-thread compatible battery and a 510-thread oil cartridge. Screw the cartridge onto the battery, set the desired voltage (if your battery has a variable voltage setting), and press the button to inhale.

To use the distillate syringes, you can either use them to refill a 510-thread oil cartridge or you can eat the distillate directly. If you're eating the distillate directly, start with a small amount (about the size of a grain of rice) and see how you feel. You can always take more if you need to, but you can't take it out of your system once you've eaten it.

To make edibles using the oil bottles and capsules, you can just add them to your favorite foods or drinks. Start with a small amount and see how you feel. You can always take more if you need to, but you can't take it out of your system once you've eaten it.

To determine the right dosage for yourself, start with a small amount and see how you feel. You can always take more if you need to, but you can't take it out of your system once you've taken it. If you're using the distillate directly, start with about the size of a grain of rice. If you're using the oil bottles or capsules, start with about 5mg of THC.

It's important to remember that everyone's experience with cannabis is different. What works for one person might not work for another. Start with a small amount and see how you feel. You can always take more if you need to, but you can't take it out of your system once you've taken it.</blockquote>",0

Samedi, en début d'après-midi, la marine nationale en Polynésie française a réalisé une saisie de près de 90 kilos de cocaïne à une centaine de miles nautiques dans le sud-ouest de Fakarava. Le voilier suspect, repéré par un Falcon 200 de la flotille 25F basée à Tahiti, était suivi depuis quelques jours par les moyens de surveillance de la marine nationale. L'intervention des moyens maritimes a été déclenchée samedi à 14h10 par le lancement d'un hélicoptère Dauphin de l'escadrille 35F.

A son arrivée sur zone, le Dauphin intercepte le voilier et contraint les suspects à se rendre avant qu'ils n'aient le temps de jeter ces stupéfiants par-dessus bord. 24 ballots de cocaïne, d'un poids total de près de 90 kilos, et 250 litres de gasoil sont saisis à bord.

Les cinq suspects, deux chiliens et trois péruviens, ont été interpellés et placés en garde à vue à la gendarmerie de Papeete. Cette nouvelle saisie de drogue vient confirmer la vigilance des moyens de surveillance déployés par la marine nationale et des services douaniers pour lutter contre les trafics de stupéfiants en Polynésie française.",0

6,6,,,"[('', '')]","The latest poll shows that only 34% of American adults believe Joe Biden is doing a good job as president. That’s down from 59% in April 2021. His approval rating has been declining steadily since then, and it’s now at its lowest point since he took office.

There are a number of reasons for Biden’s declining popularity. One is the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has caused economic hardship for many Americans, and it has also led to a great deal of uncertainty and anxiety. Biden has been criticized for his handling of the pandemic, and some people feel that he has not done enough to help Americans through this difficult time.

Another reason for Biden’s declining popularity is the rise of inflation. Inflation has been rising steadily in recent months, and it is now at its highest level in decades. This is making it more difficult for Americans to afford basic necessities, and it is causing financial hardship for many families. Biden has been criticized for his policies, which some people believe have contributed to inflation.

Finally, Biden’s popularity has also been hurt by the ongoing war in Ukraine. The war has caused a great deal of uncertainty and anxiety around the world, and it has also led to higher energy prices. Biden has been criticized for his handling of the war, and some people feel that he has not done enough to support Ukraine.

Biden’s declining popularity is a serious problem for his presidency. If he does not improve his approval ratings, it will be difficult for him to pass his legislative agenda and to lead the country effectively.",0

ভারতের দিল্লিতে এক প্রাকৃতিক ইতিহাস জাদুঘর

<b>ন্যাশনাল মিউজিয়াম অব ন্যাচারাল হিস্ট্রি</b> (এনএমএনএইচ) ভারতের নয়াদিল্লিতে নেহেরু রোডের দুধধারায় অবস্থিত প্রাকৃতিক ইতিহাসের একটি জাদুঘর। রাষ্ট্রপতি প্রণব মুখার্জী ২০১৬ সালের ১৭ই জুন ভবনটির উদ্বোধন করেন। এটি ভারতের একমাত্র ন্যাচারাল হিস্ট্রি জাদুঘর এবং এটি একটি অধস্তন রাজ্য-সংস্থা কাউন্সিল অব সায়েন্টিফিক অ্যান্ড ইন্ডাস্ট্রিয়াল রিসার্চ (সিএসআইআর)-এর অন্তর্ভুক্ত।

<h2>ইতিহাস</h2>

১৯৭৮ সালে সিএসআইআর অধীন জাতীয় জাদুঘর ফর ন্যাচারাল হিস্ট্রি প্রতিষ্ঠার জন্য একটি প্রস্তাব গঠন করা হয়। পাঁচ সদস্যের একটি প্রকল্প কমিটি গঠনের সিদ্ধান্ত নেওয়া হয় যা এগারোটি বিশেষজ্ঞ ও সদস্যের একটি প্রকল্প কমিটির পরিবর্তে বরাদ্দ করা হয় যা এর আগে এই প্রকল্প সম্পর্কে আলোচনা করেছিল। জাদুঘরটির প্রাথমিক কার্যক্রম জাতীয় উদ্ভিদ প্রতিষ্ঠান, শান্তিনিকেতন, পশ্চিমবঙ্গের সিএসআইআর ফাউন্ডেশন দ্বারা পরিচালিত হয়। ১৯৮২ সালে একটি জাদুঘর বিভাগ সিএসআইআর সদর দফতরে স্থাপন করা হয়। একটি নতুন জাদুঘর ভবন নির্মাণের জন্য সরকার ১৯৯১ সালে টাকা বরাদ্দ করে। অবশেষে ২০১৫-২০১৬ সালে জাদুঘরের ভবনের নির্মাণ শেষ হয়।

<h2>গ্যালারি</h2>

জাদুঘরটিতে পাঁচটি গ্যালারি রয়েছে যার মধ্যে ২০টি অংশ রয়েছে:

* প্রাকৃতিক বিবর্তনের গ্যালারি
* পৃথিবী বাস্তুসংস্থার গ্যালারি
* ভারতের বাস্তুসংস্থার গ্যালারি
* মানুষের ও প্রকৃতির মধ্যে সম্পর্কের গ্যালারি
* বন্যপ্রাণী বিদ্যা সম্পদ কেন্দ্র

<strong>Jarel Wilson:</strong>

Professional football player who went from street hustler to first-round draft pick to wealthy pro athlete. After two seasons with the Bills, Wilson was traded to the Vikings. His professional career was halted when he was sentenced to jail for possessing crack cocaine.

<strong>Kevin Foster:</strong>

Foster was arrested in March 2006 for possessing marijuana and crack cocaine. He admitted to a federal judge that he had received and distributed drugs in the Atlanta area since 2001.

<strong>Corey Dillon:</strong>

He had a bad habit of getting in trouble with the law. For years, Dillon had run-ins with the law: in 1999, he was cited for driving while intoxicated; in 2001, he was caught with marijuana; in 2002, he was arrested for drug possession and carrying a concealed weapon; and in 2005, he was again cited for driving while intoxicated.

<strong>Cedric Benson:</strong>

He was arrested and charged with misdemeanor simple assault after he allegedly grabbed the woman by the neck and threw her to the floor. The 10-year veteran running back has been in trouble with the law in the past. In 2009, he was sentenced to a three-year probation and fined $1,048 after he was convicted of misdemeanor assault with a deadly weapon. In 2010, Benson was arrested in Austin, Texas, on a charge of driving while intoxicated.

<strong>Ray Rice:</strong>

Rice was arrested and charged with third-degree aggravated assault after he allegedly struck his then-fiancée, Janay Palmer, in the face at an Atlantic City casino in February 2014. The charges were later dropped after Rice completed a pretrial intervention program. However, the incident led to the NFL suspending Rice for the 2014 season.

<strong>Adrian Peterson:</strong>

Peterson was indicted on a felony child abuse charge in September 2014 after he allegedly beat his 4-year-old son with a switch. The charges were later reduced to a misdemeanor and Peterson pleaded no contest. He was sentenced to probation and community service.

<strong>Josh Gordon:</strong>

He was suspended by the NFL for the entire 2015 season for violating the league’s substance abuse policy. This was his third suspension in four years. In 2013, he was suspended for two games for violating the league’s substance abuse policy, and in 2014, he was suspended for 10 games for violating the league’s substance abuse policy.

<strong>Martavis Bryant:</strong>

He was suspended for the entire 2016 season for violating the league’s substance abuse policy. This was his second suspension in three years. In 2014, he was suspended for four games for violating the league’s substance abuse policy.

<strong>Vontaze Burfict:</strong>

He was suspended for the first three games of the 2016 season for violating the league’s personal conduct policy. This was his fourth suspension in five years. In 2013, he was suspended for one game for violating the league’s personal conduct policy, and in 2014, he was suspended for three games for violating the league’s personal conduct policy. In 2015, he was suspended for 12 games for violating the league’s personal conduct policy.

<strong>Kareem Hunt:</strong>

Kansas City Chiefs running back Kareem Hunt was released by the team on Friday after a video surfaced of him shoving and kicking a woman in a Cleveland hotel in February. The incident, which took place shortly after the Chiefs’ playoff victory over the Indianapolis Colts, was caught on security camera and released by TMZ. Hunt has been charged with two counts of battery. 

This is the latest in a series of incidents involving NFL players committing violent acts. In recent years, players such as Ray Rice, Adrian Peterson, and Josh Gordon have all been suspended or released from their teams after being arrested for domestic violence or other violent crimes.",0

🧘‍♀️ Om Symbol Progression......

""ऊँ” is the only mantra having all the Vedas four in it. This is the only mantra which represents the entire universe. In the above picture, the “ऊं” Symbol shows the four Vedas ( ऋग्वेद, यजुर्वेद, सामवेद, and अथर्ववेद) This is the reason why this symbol is considered significant in all the Hindu religious scriptures.

The “ॐ” is composed of three sounds: “अ” , “उ” and “म” . The sound “अ” refers to the waking state (विश्व) or the physical plane of existence. It also signifies Brahma, the creator of the universe. The “ऊ” represents the dream state (तैजस) or the subtle plane of existence. This intermediate realm, sometimes called the dream state, refers to the realm of Vishnu, the preserver of the universe. The final sound “म” represents the deep sleep state (प्राज्ञ) or the causal plane of existence. This realm, sometimes called the state of dreamless sleep, corresponds to Shiva, the transformer or destroyer of the universe.

The “ऊं” symbol also represents the three gunas or qualities of material nature: sattva, rajas, and tamas. Sattva is the quality of goodness, light, and purity. Rajas is the quality of passion, activity, and attachment. Tamas is the quality of ignorance, darkness, and inertia. These three qualities are always present in the universe in different proportions. When sattva is predominant, there is peace, harmony, and clarity. When rajas is predominant, there is activity, passion, and movement. When tamas is predominant, there is ignorance, darkness, and inertia. All three qualities are necessary for the universe to exist, but when one quality becomes too dominant, it can cause imbalance and suffering.

The “ऊं” symbol is a reminder that the universe is made up of three aspects: the waking state, the dream state, and the deep sleep state. It also represents the three gunas of material nature: sattva, rajas, and tamas. When these three aspects are in balance, there is peace, harmony, and clarity. When one aspect becomes too dominant, it can cause imbalance and suffering.

The “ऊं” symbol is a powerful tool for meditation and self-realization. By chanting the “ऊं” mantra, we can connect with the higher consciousness and experience the inner peace and bliss.",0

Muller admitted that it’s too early within the season to say the match will determine the title race. Nonetheless, the 33-year-old needs Bayern to set a marker for the remainder of the season. 

“The sport in opposition to Dortmund is particular, it’s an enormous image. We have now to defend like males, present a closed efficiency, and put our stamp on the sport,” Muller stated in an interview with Sport1.

“We need to set the tone for the opposite groups in opposition to Dortmund. If you wish to get into the highest places, you must beat Dortmund and take factors off them.”

Bayern Munich have been in poor type this season, dropping two of their opening eight video games. The Bundesliga champions sit third within the league desk, 4 factors behind leaders Union Berlin and one level behind Dortmund in second. 

The Bavarians have been significantly poor defensively this season, conceding ten targets in eight matches. Muller has urged his staff to enhance their defensive efficiency in opposition to Dortmund. 

“We have to shut up store and never concede any foolish targets. We have to put our bodies on the road, perhaps be a bit dirtier. It is Der Klassiker and we need to win,” Muller added. 

Bayern Munich’s harm issues have compounded their defensive woes this season. Each Lucas Hernandez and Dayot Upamecano are out injured, whereas new signing Matthijs de Ligt is but to seek out his ft on the membership. 

The German champions will likely be determined to return to successful methods on Saturday. Bayern Munich have not misplaced to Dortmund in any competitors since 2019.",0

En este artículo se analiza la relación causal entre crecimiento e inflación en Guatemala. Para ello se utiliza una muestra anual para el período 1950-2004. Se aplican técnicas econométricas de raíces unitarias y cointegración de primer orden, con lo cual se encuentra que ninguna de las series es estacionario ni existe una relación de largo plazo entre ambas variables.

I. Introducción

En el presente artículo se analiza la relación crecimiento e inflación en Guatemala. El estudio de esta relación es importante desde el punto de vista de la política económica, ya que si entre estas dos variables existiera una relación negativa se podrían generar políticas que promuevan el crecimiento económico sin que éste genere inflación.

El interés en esta relación se remonta a la década de 1950, cuando los economistas clásicos y los keynesianos planteaban que era posible lograr un crecimiento económico rápido sin inflación. Sin embargo, la experiencia de la década de 1970 mostró que era posible tener una combinación de alto crecimiento e inflación elevada. Esto generó una nueva ola de investigaciones teóricas y empíricas sobre la relación crecimiento-inflación.

Unos de los primeros estudios sobre este tema fueron los de Barro (1991, 1994), quien sostenía que existía una relación negativa entre crecimiento e inflación en el largo plazo. Esto significa que cuando la inflación es alta, el crecimiento económico es bajo, y viceversa.

Otros estudios, como los de Kormendi y Meguire (1985) y Bruno y Easterly (1998), encontraron que la relación entre crecimiento e inflación es positiva en el corto plazo, pero negativa en el largo plazo. Esto significa que un aumento en la inflación puede generar un crecimiento económico más rápido en el corto plazo, pero a costa de un menor crecimiento en el largo plazo.

La relación entre crecimiento e inflación también ha sido estudiada en el caso de Guatemala. Sin embargo, los resultados de estos estudios son mixtos. Algunos estudios, como los de García y Wong (1999) y Wong (2001), encontraron que existe una relación negativa entre crecimiento e inflación. Otros estudios, como los de Martínez y Mendoza (2003) y Mendoza (2004), encontraron que no existe una relación clara entre estas dos variables.

El presente estudio tiene como objetivo analizar la relación crecimiento e inflación en Guatemala, tomando en cuenta los resultados de los estudios previos sobre este tema. Para ello se utiliza una muestra anual para el período 1950-2004. Se aplican técnicas econométricas de raíces unitarias y cointegración para determinar si hay una relación causal entre estas dos variables.

II. Marco Teórico

La relación crecimiento-inflación es un tema controvertido en la literatura económica. Hay dos teorías principales que tratan de explicar esta relación:

* La teoría neoclásica sostiene que existe una relación negativa entre crecimiento e inflación en el largo plazo. Esto se debe a que la inflación reduce el valor real del dinero, lo que hace más difícil para las empresas invertir y crecer. Además, la inflación genera incertidumbre, lo que también desalienta la inversión.
* La teoría keynesiana sostiene que existe una relación positiva entre crecimiento e inflación en el corto plazo. Esto se debe a que la inflación puede estimular el gasto y la demanda agregada, lo que puede generar un crecimiento económico más rápido. Sin embargo, a largo plazo la inflación puede generar problemas económicos, como el aumento de la deuda pública y el déficit comercial.

Las dos teorías tienen implicaciones importantes para la política económica. La teoría neoclásica sugiere que los gobiernos deberían tratar de controlar la inflación para promover el crecimiento económico. La teoría keynesiana sugiere que los gobiernos pueden utilizar la política fiscal y monetaria para estimular el crecimiento económico, incluso si esto genera inflación.

En el caso específico de Guatemala, la relación entre crecimiento e inflación es compleja. Por un lado, la inflación ha sido relativamente baja en los últimos años, lo que ha favorecido el crecimiento económico. Por otro lado, la inflación aún es relativamente alta en comparación con los países desarrollados, lo que puede generar problemas económicos en el futuro.

III. Metodología

Para analizar la relación crecimiento e inflación en Guatemala, se utiliza una muestra anual para el período 1950-2004. Las variables utilizadas en el estudio son:

* Crecimiento económico: Producto Interno Bruto real (PIB) per cápita.
* Inflación: Índice de Precios al Consumidor (IPC).

Para determinar si existe una relación causal entre crecimiento e inflación, se aplican técnicas econométricas de raíces unitarias y cointegración.

La prueba de raíces unitarias se utiliza para determinar si una serie temporal es estacionaria o no. Una serie es estacionaria si su media y su varianza son constantes a lo largo del tiempo.

La prueba de cointegración se utiliza para determinar si dos o más series temporales están cointegradas. Dos series están cointegradas si existen una combinación lineal de las dos series que es estacionaria.

Si dos series están cointegradas, significa que existe una relación de largo plazo entre ellas. Esto significa que los movimientos de una serie están relacionados con los movimientos de la otra serie.

IV. Resultados

Los resultados de las pruebas de raíces unitarias y cointegración se muestran en la Tabla 1.

Tabla 1: Resultados de las pruebas de raíces unitarias y cointegración

Variable Test de raíz unitaria Test de cointegración
Crecimiento ADF -3.12 -2.89
Inflación ADF -3.21 -2.90

Como se observa en la tabla, ninguna de las series es estacionaria, por lo que no se puede aplicar una prueba de cointegración. Esto significa que no existe una relación de largo plazo entre crecimiento e inflación en Guatemala.

El siguiente paso es aplicar una transformación a las series para que sean estacionarias. Una de las transformaciones más comunes es la transformación en diferencias. Esta transformación consiste en restarle a cada valor de la serie su valor anterior.

Los resultados de las pruebas de raíces unitarias y cointegración después de aplicar la transformación en diferencias se muestran en la Tabla 2.

Tabla 2: Resultados de las pruebas de raíces unitarias y cointegración después de aplicar la transformación en diferencias

Variable Test de raíz unitaria Test de cointegración
Crecimiento ADF -2.89 -4.56
Inflación ADF -2.90 -4.57

Como se observa en la tabla, ahora ambas series son estacionarias. Esto significa que se puede aplicar una prueba de cointegración.

El resultado de la prueba de cointegración es que las dos series están cointegradas. Esto significa que existe una relación de largo plazo entre crecimiento e inflación en Guatemala.

La relación de largo plazo entre crecimiento e inflación se puede representar mediante una ecuación de cointegración. La ecuación de cointegración para el caso de Guatemala es la siguiente:

crecimiento = -0.012 + 0.003 inflación

Esta ecuación significa que por cada aumento de un punto porcentual en la inflación, el crecimiento económico disminuye en 0.012 puntos porcentuales.

V. Conclusiones

El análisis de la relación crecimiento e inflación en Guatemala muestra que no existe una relación de largo plazo entre estas dos variables. Esto significa que los gobiernos pueden promover el crecimiento económico sin generar inflación, y viceversa.

Sin embargo, el análisis también muestra que existe una relación negativa entre crecimiento e inflación en el corto plazo. Esto significa que un aumento en la inflación puede generar un crecimiento económico más rápido en el corto plazo, pero a costa de un menor crecimiento en el largo plazo.

Por lo tanto, los gobiernos deberían tratar de controlar la inflación para promover el crecimiento económico en el largo plazo. Esto se puede lograr mediante políticas que reduzcan el gasto público, aumenten los impuestos y/o contraigan la oferta de dinero.

It’s a mouth full and also a lot of work. What exactly is in it for you and how do you make the most of it?</strong>

<h2>Why Google tools?</h2>

If you do digital marketing for a small business or work for a small business, you might feel it’s hard to compete with the large companies. Big players like Amazon, large retail chains and service providers do a lot of digital marketing and have way more resources than you. Google provides you with a lot of tools that will help you to increase your online visibility and compete with the big players. They also provide you with tools to improve your understanding of your customers and their behavior on your website.

<h2>The importance of analytics</h2>

If you don’t measure your results, you don’t know what works and what does not. Without insights, you will not be able to improve your website or marketing campaigns.

Google Analytics provides you with a lot of insights into the behavior of the visitors of your website. This way you can find out how they found your site, what pages they visited and how long they stayed on your website. You can also find out what devices they’re using, which country they’re in and a lot of other data.

<h2>Improve your website</h2>

These insights can be used to improve your website and marketing campaigns. For example, you can find out which pages are performing well and which ones need to be improved. Also, you can find out which channels are driving the most traffic to your website and adjust your ad spend accordingly.

<h2>Optimize your website</h2>

Google Optimize is a tool that helps you to test different versions of your website. You can create different variations of a page, such as a different headline or a different call to action (CTA), and then test them against each other. This way you can find out which version performs best and increase your conversion rate.

<h2>Find out more about your customers</h2>

Besides the data Google Analytics provides about the behavior of the visitors of your website, Google My Business provides you with insights into who your customers are. The insights are based on demographic data collected by Google. For example, you can find out the age, gender and interests of your customers. This data can be used to create more targeted marketing campaigns.

<h2>People find you</h2>

People can find your business online by searching for it in the Google search engine. Google Search Console provides you with insights into how people are finding your website. You can find out which keywords they’re using, which pages they’re visiting and which countries they’re in. This data can be used to improve your website’s ranking in the search results.

<h2>The importance of structured data</h2>

Structured data is a way to organize the information on your website so that Google can understand it better. This will help Google to display your website in the search results and can also lead to rich snippets. Rich snippets are extra pieces of information that are shown in the search results, such as reviews or prices.

By using Google’s tools, you can improve your website, optimize your marketing campaigns and find out more about your customers. This can lead to more leads, more sales and more website traffic.

We can help you implement all of these tools and also help you create reports and dashboards to make use of all the data they provide. Get in touch for more information.",0

* Talk to your boyfriend about your feelings. Let him know that you're excited to meet his parents, but also that you're feeling shy and nervous. He can reassure you and help you feel more relaxed.
* Do some research on your boyfriend's parents. Find out what they do for a living, what their interests are, and what kind of people they are. This will help you feel more prepared for the conversation.
* Dress appropriately. You don't need to wear anything fancy, but you should dress neatly and respectfully.
* Be polite and respectful. Treat your boyfriend's parents with respect, and listen to what they have to say.
* Be yourself. Don't try to be someone you're not. Just be yourself and let your personality shine through.
* Ask questions. Show that you're interested in your boyfriend's parents by asking them questions about their lives.
* Offer to help out. If you see a way that you can help out, don't be afraid to offer. This will show your boyfriend's parents that you're a willing and helpful person.
* Relax and have fun. The most important thing is to relax and have fun. Meeting your boyfriend's parents for the first time should be a positive experience.

Remember, your boyfriend's parents are just people, and they're probably just as interested in getting to know you as you are in getting to know them. Just be yourself, be polite, and have fun!

Dies gab die Recording Academy, die die Grammy Awards vergibt, am Dienstag bekannt. Taylor wurde im März 2020 bei einer Polizeiaktion in ihrer Wohnung in Louisville, Kentucky, von Polizisten erschossen. Im September gewannen Megan Thee Stallion und Beyoncé bei den BET Awards einen Preis für ihr gemeinsames Lied ""Savage Remix"", in dem Taylor gedacht wird.

Die Polizei war zu Taylors Wohnung gekommen, weil sie verdächtigt wurde, an einem Drogenring beteiligt zu sein. Der Haftbefehl gegen sie war jedoch fehlerhaft. Als die Beamten die Wohnung stürmten, wurde Taylor nach Angaben ihres Freundes von ihnen erschossen. Die Polizisten gaben an, der Freund habe auf sie geschossen, weshalb sie das Feuer erwidert hätten.

From my understanding when I dipped my toes into it a few years ago, you can just add it as an ingredient. It's just a dehydrated form of butter after all. It can be rehydrated with water or milk then added as an ingredient. 

As for the amount...well, that depends on the recipe. If you're just adding it to a batter or dough, you could use a 1:1 ratio of powdered butter to regular butter. So if a recipe calls for 1 cup of butter, you could use 1 cup of powdered butter and 1 cup of water or milk.

As for baking with it? Well, I've never done that so I can't really say. I imagine it would be similar to using butter, but you might have to adjust the amount of liquid you use.

Ultimately, the best way to find out how to use powdered butter is to experiment. Start with a small amount and see how it affects the recipe. You can always add more, but it's hard to take it away!",0

<b>קרב בוג</b> (ברוסית: Битва на реке Буг) היה קרב במלחמת העולם השנייה שנערך בין 7 ל-12 בספטמבר 1941 במהלך המתקפה הגרמנית על ברית המועצות בחזית המזרחית. בקרב ניצחו כוחות ורמאכט בפיקודו של פילדמרשל גינטר פון קלוגה על כוחות הצבא האדום של תחת פיקודם של מפקדי החזית הדרום-מערבית, סמיון טימושנקו, והחזית הדרומית, איוואן טיולנב.

הגרמנים כבשו את מרבית אוקראינה בתוך פחות מחודשיים במהלך הקרב, מה שייצב את הדרום של הכיבוש הגרמני בברית המועצות לראשונה מאז תחילת המלחמה, ואפשר להם לפנות לפעולות נרחבות יותר כנגד מערכי הצבא האדום במוסקבה ובצפון במטרה לכבוש את בירת ברית המועצות.

<h2>רקע</h2>

במהלך השבועות הראשונים של המלחמה, הצבא האדום ספג מכה כבדה בחזית המזרחית. קבוצת ארמיות הצפון כבשה במהירות את מדינות הבלט והייתה בדרכה ללנינגרד. קבוצת ארמיות מרכז כבשה את ביילורוסיה והגיעה במרחק של 170 קילומטרים ממוסקבה. קבוצת ארמיות דרום כבשה את אוקראינה המערבית והייתה בדרכה לקייב.

בינתיים, אוקראינה הייתה למטרה הגרמנית הראשית במלחמה בחזית המזרח, שכן היא הייתה משאב כלכלי חשוב של תעשייה וחומרים גולמיים. קרבות עזים התחוללו באוקראינה בחודשיים הראשונים של המלחמה, אך כוחות הצבא הגרמני השיגו מספר ניצחונות מכריעים. הצבא האדום אמנם הצליח לכבוש בחזרה את קייב והעוצמות הגרמניות באזור הועמדו בסכנה, אך קבוצת ארמיות דרום הצליחה להיחלץ ולשוב להתקדם אל קייב. בקרב אומן, הצליחו הכוחות הגרמניים לכתר שלושה צבאות מהצבא האדום בין ה-15 ל-16 באוגוסט, ולכבוש את אומן. ניסיון של הצבא האדום ליצור פתח יציאה מהכיתור נכשל. מפקד מפקדת החזית הדרומית-מערבית, ניקולאי פודגורני, הצליח להימלט בכניעה, אך מפקד הארמייה ה-6 והארמייה ה-12, איליה בווארין ופאבל פונומרנקו נהרגו.

בשלב זה החליט מנהיג ברית המועצות, יוסיף סטלין, כי ניצחון גרמני באוקראינה עלול לגרום להפסקת ההתנגדות הסובייטית למלחמה. הוא זרק את כל כוחות המילואים של הצבא האדום למערכה. עם זאת, כוחות אלו היו מאומנים בצורה גרועה, והופנו ישירות משדות האימונים לשדה הקרב. לאחר תקופת אימונים ראשונית, הכוחות נשלחו לקרב ללא טקטיקות לחימה ברורות. כתוצאה מכך, הכוחות הסובייטים התקשו להתארגן מול המתקפות הגרמניות המסודרות, וסבלו מאבדות כבדות.

<h2>מהלך הקרב</h2>

ב-14 ביולי 1941, הורה אדולף היטלר, עליו פיקד פילדמרשל גינטר פון קלוגה, לצאת למתקפה על קייב. המטרה הייתה להשמיד את ציוד צבאי סובייטי רב בפריפריות של העיר ולהרוס את המערך הצבאי הסובייטי ליד נהר הבוג. קלוגה חלק את הצבא הגרמני שלו לארבע קבוצות: קבוצת פרנץ בק עברה דרך מחוז קייב מניקולייב. קבוצת קרל היינריך פון שטולפנאגל עברה לכיוון המחוז מאומן. קבוצת הרמן הות עברה מן המחוז ויניצה. קבוצת קורפוס הפאנצר ה-1 בפיקודו של אויגן פון קלאיסט עברה דרך מחוז ז'יטומיר.

ב-7 בספטמבר החלו הגרמנים את המתקפה. ההתקפה החלה עם החדשות על נסיגת הצבא האדום מקייב. ב-19 בספטמבר, העיר נפלה לידי הגרמנים. הכוחות הגרמנים כבשו את קו ההגנה הסובייטי על נהר הבוג תוך ימים ספורים. קייב נפלה ללא קרב.

בשטח אוקראינה נותר הצבא האדום ללא מנהיגות ברורה. ב-19 בספטמבר, פיקוד החזית הדרום מערבית הוחלף על ידי המרשל סמיון טימושנקו. הוא החליט לרכז מחדש את כוחות הצבא האדום ליד הקו שבין פולטבה, קייב, וז'יטומיר.

במהלך קרבות הבוג, הכוחות הגרמניים כבשו כמעט את כל אוקראינה והגיעו לאזור קו חרקוב-דון. כיבוש אוקראינה גרם לשואה המתמשכת ולרצח עם האוקראיני הרעב. 5.5 מיליון אוקראינים גוועו ברעב משנת 1941 עד 1944, בעוד שהגרמנים והמשתפי פעולה האוקראיניים לקחו מהם את האספקה. ב-12 בספטמבר הצבא האדום נסוג אל מעבר לקו החדש שבין חרקוב, פולטבה, וקרמנצ'וג.

<h2>תוצאות הקרב</h2>

הקרב הסתיים בכיבוש גרמני של אוקראינה, והכוחות הסובייטים נסוגו מעבר לנהר הדון. הניצחון הגרמני בקרב פתח את הדרך למבצע ברברוסה, המתקפה הגרמנית על מוסקבה. המתקפה הגרמנית על מוסקבה נכשלה ודבר זה גרם לשינוי משמעותי במלחמה. הצבא הסובייטי הצליח להדוף את המתקפה הגרמנית ולכבוש מחדש את אוקראינה.

הניצחון הגרמני בקרב בוג היה משמעותי גם בשל ההשפעה שתיתכן הייתה לו על המשך המלחמה. אוקראינה הייתה המרכז התעשייתי של ברית המועצות, והכיבוש הגרמני של האזור נתן להם גישה למשאבים חשובים. כמו כן, אוקראינה הייתה מקור חשוב של מזון לרוסים, והכיבוש הגרמני של האזור השפיע על אופן ניהול המלחמה ברוסיה.

I am trying to measure the left, top, right, and bottom of a PDF document. I am trying to do this with Core Graphics. I am able to get the current dimensions of the page I am on, but I am not sure what resource I am supposed to use to find the PDF document's dimensions. I know the PDF document is larger than the page, so how do I find the dimensions of the entire document? Does anyone know what I am supposed to do?

[Answer 1]

In order to measure the whole document you need to use the <code>CGPDFDocumentGetMediaBox</code> function. It returns the media box for the whole document (which is the region that shall contain all the pages).

You should also take in consideration that a PDF document can have a crop box which may be smaller than the media box. It's the region of the MediaBox (MediaBox is the boundary of the whole document) that will actually be printed, displayed or used as the film negative.

To get it, you can use the <code>CGPDFDocumentGetCropBox</code> function.

You can also use different boxes, depending on what information you need.

Here is a list of all the boxes that are supported by Core Graphics.

For each type of box you can get the width and the height with <code>CGRectGetWidth</code> and <code>CGRectGetHeight</code> respectively.

[Answer 2]

I am working with raster graphics, so I don't know how much this will help, but I used the code below to draw the CGPDFPage to a Core Graphics context, and then I could get the size of the context, which is the size of the page:

<code>CGContextRef context = CGBitmapContextCreate(NULL, width, height, 8, width * 4, CGColorSpaceCreateDeviceRGB(), kCGBitmapByteOrderDefault | kCGImageAlphaPremultipliedFirst);

CGPDFPageRef page = CGPDFDocumentGetPage(_pdfDocument, pageNumber);

C’était à l’époque le plus grand immeuble du quartier de Chelsea, d’où son nom. Dès l’origine, le luxe était au rendez-vous avec ses escaliers majestueux, ses plafonds peints à la main et ses fresques magnifiques.

Tout de suite considéré comme un hôtel-résidence de luxe, il a vu défiler une multitude de célébrités : Mark Twain, Tennessee Williams, Dylan Thomas, Arthur Miller, Henri Miller, Janis Joplin, Jack Kerouac, Jim Morrison, John Lennon, Joni Mitchell, Bob Dylan, Dylan Thomas, Miles Davis, Dennis Hopper, Sid Vicious, Roberto Bolaño, Ethan Hawke, Madonna, Julian Schnabel et bien d'autres. Certains le considérèrent comme leur lieu de villégiature, d’autres comme leur adresse permanente.

Tenu par Stanford White, un architecte réputé qui avait dessiné les plans de l’hôtel, et par sa femme, il accueillit une clientèle tout aussi réputée. Les écrivains et artistes étaient particulièrement nombreux, en particulier les bohèmes. Petit à petit, l’hôtel devint un lieu de rencontre de l’élite culturelle de New York.

En 1958, l’hôtel est acheté par Stanley Bard et Joseph Gross, qui décident de le remodeler et de lui donner une nouvelle image, tout en gardant un esprit bohème. Ils créèrent des chambres avec des cuisines privées, très pratiques pour des locataires résidant à l’hôtel de nombreuses années, et laissèrent les habitants décorer comme bon leur semblait. L’esprit de l’hôtel était unique à cette époque.

En 1966, après des années de pression, la ville de New York reconnaît enfin l’intérêt historique du Chelsea Hotel. En 1977, le bâtiment est désigné comme monument historique, mais cela n’empêchera pas les propriétaires de vendre l’hôtel au magnat de l'hôtellerie Ira Drukier, qui le transforma en hôtel touristique.

En 2007, Drukier céda l’hôtel à Joseph Chetrit et Richard Born pour 80 millions de dollars. Les deux hommes annoncèrent vouloir fermer l’hôtel pour le transformer en copropriété de luxe. Face à la mobilisation des artistes et de la population de New York, le projet fut abandonné en 2011. Rupert Murdoch racheta finalement l’hôtel pour 86 millions de dollars en janvier 2013, avec l'intention de le transformer en appartements de luxe.

En 2015, il fut classé monument historique par la ville de New York, ce qui empêcha toute destruction. L'intérieur de l'hôtel a été entièrement rénové et abrite désormais des appartements de luxe, des bureaux et un hôtel. Le hall d'entrée, lui, est toujours aussi magnifique, et de nombreux éléments d'époque ont été conservés.

Le Chelsea Hotel a eu une influence considérable sur la culture de New York et est resté un lieu important pour les artistes et les intellectuels de la ville. Il a été le cadre de nombreux films, émissions de télévision et livres, et est considéré comme un symbole de l'histoire culturelle de New York.",0

Para ello, los investigadores utilizaron un material revolucionario para fabricar células solares. Se trata de un tipo de enlace molecular que permite reconfigurar su estructura para que se adapte mejor a la absorción de las diferentes longitudes de onda de la luz solar. Este material es un compuesto orgánico llamado FTPP (antraceno-tifeno-fia-pirrolo-pirrol), que puede absorber casi toda la luz visible y producir una corriente eléctrica.

El FTPP es un material inorgánico flexible y transparente que puede aplicarse a las superficies de una amplia variedad de materiales, como el vidrio y el polímero PET. Esto hace que sea un material muy versátil para su uso en paneles solares y otras tecnologías de energía renovable.

Los investigadores han podido demostrar que el FTPP puede generar hasta un 15% más de electricidad que las células solares convencionales de silicio. Además, es más barato de fabricar que el silicio, lo que podría hacer que las células solares sean más asequibles para los consumidores.

El siguiente paso para los investigadores es continuar mejorando la eficiencia del FTPP y desarrollar nuevos materiales similares que puedan absorber otros tipos de luz, como la luz ultravioleta o la infrarroja. Esto podría conducir al desarrollo de células solares aún más eficientes capaces de generar electricidad a partir de una gama más amplia de fuentes de luz.",0

He was born in Cardiff on 18 December 1881. Initially he studied at the University of Wales College of Medicine in Cardiff but after graduating in 1904 he continued studying in London where he became a member of the Royal College of Physicians in 1907 and a fellow in 1918.

In 1912 he was appointed assistant physician at the University College Hospital in London. During World War I he served in the Royal Army Medical Corps in Egypt and Salonika.

After the war he continued working at the University College Hospital. He became full physician in 1921 and physician-in-charge from 1922 to 1937. In 1937 he was appointed director of the Clinical Research Unit at the Medical Research Council of the UK.

Lewis is chiefly remembered for his work on electrocardiography and angina pectoris. He published nearly 200 papers on various subjects including heart murmurs, coronary artery disease, and paroxysmal tachycardia. Of special note is his 1935 paper which proposed the term ""effort angina"" to describe angina pectoris precipitated by physical exertion.

He died on 17 April 1945.

Once upon a time, in a small town nestled amidst rolling hills, lived a baker named Kisho who had an extraordinary passion for creating delicious treats. One crisp winter morning, as the sun cast golden rays upon the town, Kisho awoke with a sudden inspiration. He had always wanted to create something unique and magical—a cake that would leave people spellbound with its flavors and beauty.

Driven by his passion, Kisho began experimenting with new ingredients and techniques in his cozy bakery. After countless trials and errors, he finally stumbled upon a divine masterpiece—the Kisho's Red Velvet. This magnificent cake was an instant success, winning the hearts of the townspeople with its velvety soft texture, vibrant red hue, and a symphony of flavors that danced on the palate.

The secret behind Kisho's Red Velvet lay in the perfect balance of cocoa powder and buttermilk, which gave the cake its unique moistness and tanginess. The deep red color came from pure beet juice, carefully added to preserve the cake's natural sweetness. Layers of creamy cream cheese frosting, swirled between the red velvet layers, completed the masterpiece, elevating it to a work of art that captivated the senses.

Word of Kisho's Red Velvet spread like wildfire throughout the town. People came from far and wide to taste this delectable creation, and the bakery became a destination of joy and celebration. Kisho's Red Velvet found its way to birthdays, weddings, anniversaries, and all occasions that deserved a touch of magic.

As time went on, Kisho's Red Velvet became a symbol of love, happiness, and unity. The vibrant red color represented passion and joy, while the velvety texture and sweet flavors brought people together, creating moments of pure bliss. The cake became a symbol of Kisho's dedication and passion for his craft, a testament to the transformative power of a simple creation.

Kisho's Red Velvet left an indelible mark on the town and its people. It was more than just a cake; it was a symbol of creativity, love, and the beauty that can be found in everyday moments. And so, the story of Kisho's Red Velvet was passed down from generation to generation, inspiring bakers and dessert enthusiasts to create their own magical culinary wonders, spreading joy and sweetness wherever they went.",0

8月5日，在江门新会区东城北街，一个修鞋擦鞋老摊位重新开张，吸引了很多行人的目光，因此也找来了不少老顾客。



从业30余年擦鞋匠


修鞋擦鞋老摊位重新开张，吸引老顾客


这间修鞋擦鞋摊位于东城北街的摊位是新会人熟悉的老摊位。店主周耀宗为了谋生，在上个世纪90年代初学手艺，从修补皮具开始，到后来经营擦鞋，已经在这个行业里从业30多年。


“过去修皮具在街上摆摊，后来修鞋擦鞋也摆摊，但有个档口更好。”周耀宗说，他今年58岁，学了修皮具手艺之后，就到广州专门的学校学习擦皮鞋。因技术不错，他的摊位生意一直不错，很多人慕名而来。


自己配色做出擦鞋油

周耀宗拿出刚做成的擦鞋油，要给顾客擦鞋

周耀宗介绍，虽然大家都叫擦鞋匠，但他更愿意自称“擦皮鞋艺术家”。“鞋子在脚上很显眼，要让客人穿着美观、舒服，擦鞋的功夫很关键，这就像艺术一样。”周耀宗笑道。

周耀宗说，他的顾客很多，很多回头客可能是一个月过来擦一次，还有一些是长期在这附近工作的，每天早上会过来让他擦皮鞋。因此，很多顾客都成为了他的朋友。


“我不是随便买盒擦鞋油直接擦的，而是根据皮鞋的颜色自己调配擦鞋油。”周耀宗说，顾客把皮鞋放在他的摊位上，他摸一摸皮鞋的材质，再看看顾客穿着的风格，就心中有数了。他拿起材料，按照不同的配比混合成不同的颜色，之后用一小块海绵轻轻地擦在顾客的皮鞋上。


周耀宗调配好的擦鞋油


“他做的擦鞋真的是很好，比我自己擦得好。”一位老顾客拿着周耀宗刚刚擦好的鞋子，对着太阳拿起来看看，连连称赞。


洗鞋3元，擦鞋5元


价格几十年没涨过


如今，周耀宗已经58岁，身子骨不如以前健朗。因此，他重新摆摊之后，擦鞋的价格也调了一下——过去擦鞋是3元，现在是5元，洗鞋过去是5元，现在是8元，加起来就13元。

周耀宗擦鞋的价格几十年没涨过，但配料越来越好

“我擦鞋的价格十几年没涨过，但买皮具油的价格却一直在涨，特别是现在的皮具油，用料更好了，成本更高。”周耀宗说，过去自制皮具油，成本较低，现在用料更好了，因此价格就涨了一些。



周耀宗说，现在的年轻人可能不会学做擦皮鞋这门手艺，“这可能是门手艺活，有点枯燥，不受年轻人待见。也可能是难学，现在的年轻人没这个耐性。”周耀宗说，他与擦鞋擦皮鞋打了30多年交道，见证了行业的没落。但他还是希望能找到年轻人拜师学艺，将这项手艺传承下去，毕竟这是他的手艺，也是养活他的技能。

The champion jump jockey remained conscious after his mount Genuflex failed to take off at the fourth fence and somersaulted, unseating Mullins in the process.

The 29-year-old's helmet came off but the severity of the incident has not deterred Mullins, who intends to ride again later this week.

He told the Daily Mail: ""I'm lucky, I got a bit of a bang to the head but I feel fine today. It's all part of the job.

""I somehow kept my wits about me, I can't really explain it. It happened so quickly. I was in no pain and I was aware of everything that was going on.

""I don't feel any different and I'm looking forward to going back racing on Wednesday. Hopefully I'm not as sore as I thought I was going to be.""

It is not the first time Mullins has endured a serious fall, having sustained a fractured skull in a point-to-point race at Ballindenisk in 2014.

He added: ""This was different. The one I had before was probably a bit more serious. I have been lucky in that I haven't had too many bad falls.

""I just have to concentrate on what I have to do and that's go racing. I'm fine, I'll get back on another horse and forget about it.""",0

<h5>by Michael Hardiman</h5>

The May meeting was moved up one week and was held on the 11th to allow the program speaker to get back to Pennsylvania before his school year ended. CSAC meetings are normally held on the third Thursday of every month.

There were only 38 members and 6 guests in attendance for this month's meeting. Thanks to John Vincent there were 2 new members. Jim Bartol (a long-time friend of CSAC) and his son Eric joined us. We hope to see more of them at future meetings.

Club vice president Craig Eichhorn called the meeting to order at 7:30 pm. Minutes from the April meeting were read and approved. Craig then announced that the club had received an Electronic Project Grant from the Astronomical League. The grant will pay for the purchase of a new computer and software for the Catoctin Mountain Observing Station. The hardware and software will be delivered and installed before the end of June.

Craig provided updates on the status of several other club projects:

* The annual CSAC Star Party will be held on August 18 and 19 at the Double Diamond Ranch, near Calhan. The event will be open to the public from 7:00 pm until midnight on Friday and from 1:00 pm until midnight on Saturday. Further details will be available later this summer.
* The club is planning to hold two astronomy courses at Colorado Springs Community College during the Fall 2006 semester. The first course will provide a general introduction to astronomy and the second will be a more advanced course that will cover topics such as stellar evolution and cosmology. More information about the courses will be available on the CSCC website within the next few months.
* The club is planning to hold a weekend astronomy workshop at the Double Diamond Ranch on September 16 and 17. The workshop will cover topics such as telescope basics, astrophotography, and deep sky observing. More information about the workshop will be available later this summer.
* The club is planning to participate in the 2006 National Science Festival, which will be held in Washington, D.C., on October 7 and 8. The club will have a booth at the festival where we will be distributing information about astronomy and the club.

Craig then congratulated John Vincent on his election as president of the Astronomical League. John will officially take office on July 1.

After a break for snacks, Jim Crawford introduced the program speaker, Dr. Michael Brotherton, an astronomer from the University of Wyoming. Dr. Brotherton's talk was entitled ""Witness to Cosmic Evolution: What Active Galaxies Can Tell Us about the Early Universe.""

Dr. Brotherton began his talk by explaining the difference between active galaxies and normal galaxies. Active galaxies are galaxies that emit large amounts of energy in the form of radio waves, X-rays, and gamma rays. This energy is produced by a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy. The black hole is surrounded by a disk of gas and dust that is being heated to very high temperatures. The heated gas and dust emit the energy that we observe.

Dr. Brotherton then discussed the different types of active galaxies. There are two main types of active galaxies: Seyfert galaxies and quasars. Seyfert galaxies are active galaxies that are relatively close to Earth. Quasars are active galaxies that are very far away from Earth. Quasars are so far away that they appear as point sources of light, even through the largest telescopes.

Dr. Brotherton explained that active galaxies can be used to study the early universe. Active galaxies are thought to be the progenitors of normal galaxies. By studying active galaxies, we can learn about the conditions that existed in the early universe and how galaxies evolved over time.

Dr. Brotherton showed us some images of active galaxies that he had taken using the Hubble Space Telescope. The images showed the supermassive black holes at the centers of the galaxies and the disks of gas and dust that surround them.

Dr. Brotherton concluded his talk by discussing the future of active galaxy research. He said that astronomers are currently using new telescopes and instruments to study active galaxies in more detail. He said that these studies are helping us to learn more about the early universe and the evolution of galaxies.

Dr. Brotherton's talk was very informative and interesting. The audience asked many questions, and Dr. Brotherton answered them all patiently and thoroughly.

Il motivo? La presenza di <strong>sostanza plastica</strong> nell’alimento. Lo ha comunicato stessa l’Azienda, precisando che il ritiro dal commercio è stato eseguito in via del tutto precauzionale.

In una nota, McDonald’s ha precisato che ""<i>il provvedimento nasce a seguito di alcune segnalazioni avvenute in altri mercati europei nelle quali si faceva riferimento al ritrovamento di frammenti di plastica all’interno del prodotto, avvenuto probabilmente in fase di produzione</i>"".

Tuttavia, in <strong>Italia</strong>, non è stata finora ricevuta nessuna segnalazione, quantomeno verificata, di questo genere.

Il ritiro è quindi <strong>a scopo cautelativo</strong> e ""<i>per garantire sempre i più elevati standard di qualità e sicurezza alimentare</i>"".

Come si legge sul sito McDonald’s Italia: ""<i>Stiamo contattando tutti i nostri fornitori per accertarci che tutti i processi di produzione siano corretti e che non si ripeta più un problema del genere. Abbiamo immediatamente ritirato il prodotto dal mercato italiano in via precauzionale. Se hai acquistato questo prodotto, ti preghiamo di non consumarlo e di riportarlo al ristorante McDonald's più vicino per un rimborso completo</i>"".

McDonald's si è scusato per l'accaduto e ha promesso di prendere tutte le misure necessarie per garantire che un problema del genere non si ripeta in futuro.

Il ritiro del Crispy Chicken Supreme dal mercato italiano è solo l'ultimo di una serie di incidenti che hanno coinvolto McDonald's negli ultimi anni. Nel 2015, la catena di fast food è stata costretta a ritirare il suo pollo alla griglia dal mercato cinese dopo che erano stati trovati antibiotici non autorizzati nel prodotto.

Nel 2017, McDonald's ha ritirato il suo latte al cioccolato dal mercato giapponese dopo che erano stati trovati pesticidi non autorizzati nel prodotto.

Nel <strong>2018</strong>, McDonald's ha ritirato il suo Chicken McNuggets dal mercato norvegese dopo che erano stati trovati pezzi di plastica nel prodotto.",0

Is this a bedbug?

https://imgur.com/a/xEl6bic

I found this on the floor of my apartment. I dont have any apparent bed bug bites and ive never seen any before.</p>

<blockquote id=""1"" pid=""0"" uid=""1"">No, that's a booklouse.</blockquote>

<blockquote id=""2"" pid=""0"" uid=""2"">Not a bedbug</blockquote>

<blockquote id=""3"" pid=""0"" uid=""3"">Ticks, Fleas and Bed Bugs all consume blood and must be inspected to identify the pest causing the infestation. If pests are found, the source of the infestation needs to be eradicated to prevent reinfestation.

The first step in eradicating bed bugs is to identify their food source and nesting areas. Bed bugs are attracted to human blood and feces. They collect in areas where people spend time, such as bedrooms, living rooms and dens. Bed bugs can also nest in mattresses, box springs, furniture, picture frames, electrical appliances, and even clothing. Adult bed bugs are about the size of an apple seed and are reddish-brown in color. They are flat and have six legs.

Bed bugs can infest any home or business. However, they are most commonly found in hotels, motels, dorms and apartments. Infestations can be difficult to detect because bed bugs do not live on their host. They feed for a short time and then return to their hiding places. Their bites often go unnoticed because they are small and do not cause much pain.

If you think you have bed bugs, there are a few things you can do:

Wash all of your bedding and clothing in hot water (at least 120 degrees Fahrenheit) and dry them on the highest heat setting. Vacuum your mattress, box spring, and carpets thoroughly. Seal any cracks or crevices in your furniture and walls where bed bugs might be hiding. Apply insecticide to areas where bed bugs are likely to be found, such as baseboards, furniture, and window frames.

If you are unable to get rid of the bed bugs on your own, you can call a pest control company to help you. It is important to act quickly if you suspect you have a bed bug infestation. The sooner you act, the easier it will be to get rid of them.</blockquote>",0

65,65,,,"[('', '')]","先日、山口県のかんきつ園、小神さんのところで、温州みかんの収穫体験をしてきました。
いつもいろいろなお話を聞かせてくれる小神さん。今回は、みかんの品種の違いについてのお話です。


<h2>・品種によって収穫時期が違う</h2>

みかんは品種によって、収穫時期が異なります。
「早生（わせ）」「中生（なかて）」「晩生（おくて）」という３つに大きく分類されます。

「早生」・・・９月中旬～１１月初旬が収穫期
「中生」・・・１１月上旬～１２月中旬が収穫期
「晩生」・・・１２月下旬～２月上旬が収穫期

ですので、冬になったからといって、すべてのみかんが食べごろになるわけではありません。
１年中、みかんを楽しめるのにも、こんな品種の工夫があるんですね。


<h2>・同じみかんでも味や形が異なる</h2>

一般的に、早生みかんは酸味があり、中生・晩生みかんは甘みがあります。
また、形も、早生みかんは丸く、中生・晩生みかんは扁円（ぺったん）になっています。

「早生」・・・酸味が強く、丸い形をしている
「中生」・・・甘みがあり、普通は扁円の形をしている
「晩生」・・・糖度が高く、扁円の形をしている

最近は、品種改良も進んで、１２月頃から出回る早生みかんも甘くなったそうです。

スーパーや果物屋さんには、早い時期から「春峰」という品種のみかんが並びますが、あれは、早生みかんです。
春峰は、酸味が少なく、糖度が高いので、とても甘いです。
春峰が食べられると、「みかんの季節が来たな～！」と嬉しくなってきます。


<h2>・産地によって品種が違う</h2>

みかんは、日本各地で栽培されています。
そのため、産地によって、栽培されている品種が異なります。

全国的に栽培されている品種は
・清美オレンジ
・ネーブルオレンジ
・ポンカン
・伊予柑
・夏みかん
・はっさく
などです。　

これらの品種は、どの産地でも、ほとんど同じ味です。

でも、その土地ならではの品種もあります。
たとえば、山口県で栽培されている小神さんの愛媛2号は、全国で5％しか栽培されていない品種で、山口県だけで収穫されます。
愛媛2号はとても甘くて、皮が薄いため、むきやすいのが特徴です。

小神さんに「みかんの木は、どのくらいの木になるんですか？」とお聞きしたら、「10メートルくらいにはなりますよ。」と教えてくれました。
こんなに大きくなるんですね！
温暖な気候で、一年中、たくさんの太陽を浴びながら育った、おいしいみかんたち。
柑橘類は、スーパーや果物屋さんで簡単に手に入りますが、生産者さんの苦労が詰まっていることを、いつも感謝していただきたいですね。",0

68,68,,,"[('', '')]","trestles Trestles Beach is a surf spot along the Pacific coast of San Diego County, approximately 10 miles (16 km) south of San Clemente. The beach and campground is part of the San Onofre State Beach, a state park managed by the California Department of Parks and Recreation. The beach gets its name from the trestle bridge that used to traverse the area where the San Diego Freeway and Amtrak grade meet. The 120-foot (37 m) wooden trestle was built in 1929 and came to be known as the ""Trestles."" The bridge was torn down in the 1960s mid-century. Trestles is considered one of the best surf spots in Southern California. The waves are created by the rocky reefs and sandbars that line the coast. The reefs break the waves, creating long, clean waves that are perfect for surfing. The waves at Trestles range from mellow beginner waves to powerful waves that are only适合advanced surfers. The best time to surf Trestles is during the summer months, when the waves are consistent. Winter swells can produce large, powerful waves, but these waves are only suitable for experienced surfers. Trestles is also a popular spot for bodyboarding, skimboarding, and stand-up paddleboarding. Trestles is home to a number of surf breaks, including Lower Trestles, Upper Trestles, and Cottons. Lower Trestles is the most popular break, and it is known for its long, clean waves. Upper Trestles is a more challenging break, with faster waves and more powerful barrels. Cottons is a smaller break, and it is best for beginner surfers. Trestles is a popular destination for surfers from all over the world. The beach is also a popular spot for camping, fishing, and picnicking. Trestle Beach Park is a 650-acre park that is located within the San Onofre State Beach. The park includes the Trestles surf breaks, as well as a campground, picnic areas, and hiking trails. Camping is available at the park, and there are also a number of restaurants and shops nearby.",0

<b>Kerch</b> (Ukrainian: Керч [kɛrtʃ]; Russian: Керчь [kʲertɕ]; Crimean Tatar: <i>Keriç</i>, pronounced [keˈritʃ]; Greek: Κερκίτις; Latin: <i>Cercetis</i>, <i>Cercis</i>, or <i>Cercita</i>) is a city of regional significance on the Kerch Peninsula in eastern Crimea. Population: 147,033 (2021 est.)

Kerch is the administrative center of the Kerch Municipality, which is subdivided into the city itself and 10 rural councils with an area of 1,886 square kilometers (728 sq mi).

The city is located on the Kerch Strait, separating Crimea from the Taman Peninsula in Krasnodar Krai, Russia. There are two bridges connecting the city with Krasnodar Krai: a road–rail bridge and a power bridge. Before the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, ferries operated across the strait.

<h2>History</h2>

The earliest traces of human settlement in the area of the Kerch Peninsula date back to the 8th millennium BC. The area was settled by Cimmerians, Scythians, Greeks and Romans in ancient times. The Milesian Greeks of Miletus founded a trading city called <i>Panticapaeum</i> (Παντικάπαιον) on the site of modern Kerch in the 7th century BC. Panticapaeum later became the capital of the Bosporan Kingdom. The city was destroyed by the Huns in the 4th century AD.

Kerch was part of the Byzantine Empire from the 6th to the 10th centuries. It was then ruled by the Pechenegs, the Cumans, the Mongols, the Genoese and the Crimean Khanate. The Ottomans conquered the city in 1475.

Kerch was annexed by the Russian Empire in 1774. It was renamed <i>Kerch</i> in 1790. The city was declared a free port in 1871. Kerch became a major industrial center in the late 19th century.

During the Russian Civil War, Kerch was occupied by the Bolsheviks in 1918. The city was captured by the White Army in 1919, but it was retaken by the Bolsheviks in 1920.

Kerch was occupied by Nazi Germany from 1941 to 1944. The city was heavily damaged during the war.

After the war, Kerch was rebuilt and it became a major industrial and cultural center of the Crimean ASSR.

Kerch became part of Ukraine in 1991 after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The city has suffered from a decline in population since the collapse of the Soviet Union, and its economy has been in decline since the Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation in 2014.

On October 8, 2022, a large explosion on the Kerch Bridge connecting Russia and Crimea caused significant damage to the bridge. A section of the road bridge collapsed into the water, leaving only one lane open for traffic. The cause of the explosion is still under investigation, but Ukrainian officials have said that it was a deliberate attack.

<h2>Population</h2>

According to the 2001 Ukrainian census, the population of Kerch was 157,021. The majority of the population were Russians (74.2%), with Ukrainians (15.3%) and Crimean Tatars (6.1%) forming significant minorities.

In 2014, after the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation, the population of Kerch was estimated to be 146,675. A referendum was held in Crimea asking voters if they would support reunification with Russia. The referendum was condemned by the Ukrainian government and the vast majority of the international community.

The economy of Kerch is based on industry, port activities, and tourism. The city is home to a number of industrial enterprises, including a steel mill, a shipyard, and a fishing port. Kerch is also a major transportation hub, with a large port that handles cargo and passengers. The city is also a popular tourist destination, with a number of historical and cultural sites, including the Kerch Fortress, the Kerch Archaeological Museum, and the Kerch Shipyard.

The Kerch Peninsula has several profitable economic sectors, most notably the transportation sector and mineral resource extraction. Some of the biggest mineral resources extracted in the region are limestone, sand, and clay. The region also has a large fishing industry. The most profitable fishing industry is the catch of sturgeon and its caviar. Kerch is also notable as the easternmost terminus of the North Crimean Canal.

From the 1990s to the 2014 annexation of Crimea by Russia, the Port of Kerch was closed to all commercial and military vessels. It was reopened to marine traffic later that year, but was closed to non-Russian commercial and military vessels by the Russian Federation from March 2018.

<h2>Culture</h2>

Kerch is a cultural center of the Crimean Peninsula. The city is home to a number of museums, theaters, and art galleries. Kerch is also a popular tourist destination, with a number of historical and cultural sites.

The main symbol of Kerch is Mount Mithridates, located in the heart of the city. On its top are the ruins of the ancient Greek city of Panticapaeum. The famous staircase of 423 steps, built in the 1830s, leads to the top of the mountain.

Other popular tourist destinations in Kerch include the Kerch Fortress, the Kerch Archaeological Museum, and the Kerch Shipyard. The Kerch Fortress was built in the 18th century to protect the city from attack. The Kerch Archaeological Museum houses a collection of artifacts from the ancient Greek, Scythian, and Roman civilizations. The Kerch Shipyard is a historic shipyard that has been in operation since the 18th century.

Kerch is also home to a number of cultural festivals and events throughout the year. One of the most popular festivals is the Kerch International Maritime Festival, which is held every year in July. The festival features a variety of maritime-themed events, including boat races, regattas, and concerts.

よく使われるカタカナの言葉に「オシャレ」「カッコイイ」「ステキ」「ルール」があります。これらは「流行」「気分」「気分」「規則」という日本語で言い換えることができますが、オシャレやカッコイイなどのカタカナの言葉を使うと、より強調される感じがします。なぜでしょうか。

その理由は、カタカナは日本語ではない言葉であるためです。そのため、カタカナの言葉を使うと、より外来的な印象を与えます。これは、カタカナが日本語とは異なる音韻体系を持っているためです。

例えば、「オシャレ」という言葉を考えてみましょう。この言葉は、「オ」「シ」「ャ」「レ」という4つの音で構成されています。これは、日本語の音韻体系では存在しない音です。そのため、「オシャレ」という言葉を聞くと、日本語ではない言葉であるという印象を与えます。

この外来的な印象が、カタカナの言葉を使うとより強調される感じがする理由です。

また、カタカナの言葉は、日本語の言葉よりも新しいことが多いです。これは、カタカナの言葉は、新しい概念を表すために作られることが多いからです。例えば、「コンピュータ」という言葉は、日本語の言葉としては存在しません。この言葉は、コンピュータという新しい概念を表すために、カタカナで作られました。

このように、カタカナの言葉は、日本語の言葉よりも新しいことが多いです。これは、カタカナの言葉を使うと、より現代的な印象を与える理由です。

83,83,,,"[('', '')]","HOLLYWOOD—I was excited to check out this week’s episode of “The Bachelorette,” as it promised to reveal the latest season’s biggest twist yet. As usual, the episode began with a recap of all the drama that has been unfolding so far. Gabby and Rachel have been on their journey to find love.

Things for Gabby seemed to be going well. During a group date, she picked Logan to be her date for the evening portion and the two seemed to hit it off. They shared some intimate moments and even went skinny dipping together. Rachel, on the other hand, seemed to be having a tougher time. She sent one of her suitors home after he made it clear that he only wanted to be with her and not Gabby.

The episode’s biggest twist came at the very end. Jesse Palmer revealed that there would be a rose ceremony that night and that both Gabby and Rachel would be able to give out roses.

The ceremony was full of surprises. Gabby gave out her first rose to Logan, but she also decided to give roses to Jason, Mario, and Johnny. Rachel gave her first rose to Tyler, but she also surprised everyone by giving roses to Aven, Tino, and Zach.

The episode ended with a cliffhanger. Jesse Palmer revealed that there would be a twist in the next episode that would change everything. We’ll have to wait and see what that twist is, but I’m sure it’s going to be something big.

Overall, I thought this episode of “The Bachelorette” was very entertaining. The drama was high and the twists and turns kept me on the edge of my seat. I’m looking forward to seeing what happens next week.",0

[Answer 1]

There could be a number of reasons why your sister is angry and jealous. Some possible explanations include:

* She may feel like she is not getting enough attention or love from her parents or other family members.
* She may be struggling with her own self-esteem and may feel inferior to you in some way.
* She may envy your accomplishments or qualities, such as your intelligence, popularity, or good looks.
* She may be going through a difficult time in her life, such as a breakup or a job loss, and this may be causing her to feel angry and resentful towards you.

If you are concerned about your sister's behavior, there are a few things you can do to try to help her:

* Talk to her about how you are feeling. Let her know that you are concerned about her and that you want to help her.
* Try to be more understanding and supportive of her. This may mean listening to her problems without judgment, or offering her help and encouragement.
* Set boundaries. If your sister's behavior is becoming disruptive or harmful, you may need to set some boundaries. This could mean telling her that you will not tolerate her being rude or disrespectful to you, or that you will have to limit your contact with her if she continues to be angry and jealous.
* Encourage her to seek professional help. If your sister's anger and jealousy are severe or are causing her significant distress, you may want to encourage her to seek professional help. A therapist can help her to understand the root of her emotions and develop coping mechanisms.

[Answer 2]

Sometimes sisters just are, and it makes no sense. You supposedly share everything, but you don’t. You’re different people with different interests and different feelings. It’s important to see her good qualities and to appreciate your relationship so that you can overlook her faults. It’s not easy when she’s mean to you, but the alternative is to give up on her. It’s worth the effort to try to understand each other.",0

95,95,,,"[('', '')]","<strong>Neuraxial drug administration.</strong> Cocaine can readily cross the blood-brain barrier when administered either systemically (IV or intranasally) or locally (intrathecally). The total concentration of cocaine in brain is a composite of both inherent regional concentration differences and relative contribution of blood versus neuraxial drug appearance. After systemic administration of 200 mg IV, the concentration of cocaine in CSF is only about 10% that of the concentration in blood. In contrast, as much as 25% of the administered dose can be measured in CSF following a 5-mg intrathecal injection. Although much of the intrathecal dose leaks into the systemic circulation, local concentrations remain high for over 8 hours. Systemic cocaine can also be detected in the spinal cord, albeit at lower concentrations than cerebrocortical concentrations.

<strong>Cardiovascular effects.</strong> Cocaine increases mean blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac output. These effects are due to inhibition of norepinephrine reuptake, resulting in enhanced sympathetic outflow. Intrathecal cocaine may be useful to treat hypotension after spinal anesthesia, although this application has been limited by variable data and potential for severe toxicity.

<strong>Respiratory effects.</strong> Cocaine is a local anesthetic of the mucous membranes and can cause numbness, burning, and other untoward sensations of the nose, sinuses, and throat. In moderate to high doses, cocaine is a respiratory stimulant that increases respiratory rate and tidal volume. However, very high doses can paralyze the muscles of respiration and may contribute to death from cocaine overdose.

<strong>Gastrointestinal effects.</strong> Systemic cocaine can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain as a result of enhancement of sympathetic outflow. Cocaine appears to inhibit appetite and has been used to promote weight loss, although this practice has been supplanted by safer centrally acting agents that promote satiety.

<strong>Central nervous system effects.</strong> In moderate doses, cocaine causes excitement, euphoria, confidence, and sociability. It can also impair judgment and decision-making capacities and may induce paranoia. Cocaine decreases the sensation of fatigue and hunger but may also induce anxiety and seizures. In chronic users, cocaine may lead to psychosis. Cocaine users often become dependent on the drug and experience depression, fatigue, and irritability when the drug is stopped.

<strong>Topical effects.</strong> Cocaine is useful as a topical anesthetic on mucous membranes owing to its ability to block sodium channels and prevent the initiation and propagation of action potentials. The regional anesthetic properties of cocaine persist after local administration for 15 to 30 minutes. As a local anesthetic, cocaine is approximately equal in potency to lidocaine and ropivacaine but exhibits a shorter duration of action. Cocaine is also a potent vasoconstrictor, and local administration can result in ischemia. As a result, cocaine is used rarely as a local anesthetic and is most commonly used topically as a nasal decongestant.

<strong>Pupillary effects.</strong> Cocaine is a sympathomimetic and can cause pupillary dilation in a dose- and route-dependent manner. Severe acute toxicity can cause pupils to dilate maximally or to remain fixed and dilated as a result of death of iris sphincter muscles from ischemia.

<strong>Antidotes.</strong> There are no specific antidotes for cocaine overdose. Treatment is supportive and includes the use of benzodiazepines to control seizures, nicardipine to reduce blood pressure, and propofol for sedation if intubation is necessary.",0

Zimmer- und Kübelpflanzen benötigen regelmäßige Düngergaben, um gesund und kräftig zu wachsen. Die richtige Dosierung und der richtige Zeitpunkt sind dabei entscheidend.

<h2>Wann Zimmerpflanzen düngen?</h2>

Die beste Zeit, Zimmerpflanzen zu düngen, ist während der Wachstumsphase, also von März bis September. Während dieser Zeit sollten die Pflanzen alle zwei bis vier Wochen gedüngt werden. Im Winter sollten die Pflanzen seltener gedüngt werden, etwa alle sechs bis acht Wochen.

<h2>Wie Zimmerpflanzen düngen?</h2>

Es gibt verschiedene Möglichkeiten, Zimmerpflanzen zu düngen. Die häufigste und einfachste Methode ist die Verwendung von Flüssigdünger. Flüssigdünger werden dem Gießwasser beigemischt und so ausgebracht. Es gibt verschiedene Flüssigdünger für verschiedene Pflanzentypen.

Eine weitere Möglichkeit, Zimmerpflanzen zu düngen, ist die Verwendung von Langzeitdünger. Langzeitdünger werden nur einmal pro Saison ausgebracht und geben dann über einen längeren Zeitraum Nährstoffe an die Pflanze ab.

Auch die Verwendung von Kompost ist eine gute Möglichkeit, Zimmerpflanzen zu düngen. Kompost ist ein natürlicher Dünger, der die Bodenstruktur verbessert und die Pflanze mit wichtigen Nährstoffen versorgt.

<h2>Wie viel Dünger für Zimmerpflanzen?</h2>

Die richtige Dosierung des Düngers ist entscheidend. Zu viel Dünger kann die Pflanze schädigen. Die Dosierung des Düngers ist auf der Verpackung angegeben.

<h2>Dünger für Zimmerpflanzen</h2>

Es gibt verschiedene Arten von Düngern, die für Zimmerpflanzen geeignet sind. Die häufigsten Arten sind:

* <strong>Flüssigdünger:</strong> Flüssigdünger werden dem Gießwasser beigemischt und so ausgebracht.
* <strong>Langzeitdünger:</strong> Langzeitdünger werden nur einmal pro Saison ausgebracht und geben dann über einen längeren Zeitraum Nährstoffe an die Pflanze ab.
* <strong>Kompost:</strong> Kompost ist ein natürlicher Dünger, der die Bodenstruktur verbessert und die Pflanze mit wichtigen Nährstoffen versorgt.

Die richtige Wahl des Düngers hängt von der Pflanzensorte und dem Standort ab.

<h2>Zimmerpflanze verbrennt</h2>

Eine Überdüngung kann bei Zimmerpflanzen zu Verbrennungen führen. Die Blätter verfärben sich dann gelb oder braun und werden schließlich absterben. Im schlimmsten Fall kann die Pflanze eingehen.

Wenn Sie befürchten, Ihre Zimmerpflanze überdüngt zu haben, sollten Sie die Pflanze gründlich gießen, um den Dünger aus dem Boden zu spülen. Anschließend sollten Sie die Pflanze für einige Zeit nicht mehr düngen.

<h2>Zimmerpflanzen nach dem Urlaub düngen</h2>

Wenn Sie Ihre Zimmerpflanzen nach dem Urlaub gießen, sollten Sie sie auch düngen. Die Pflanzen sind während der Abwesenheit geschwächt und benötigen Nährstoffe, um sich zu erholen.

Die Dosierung des Düngers sollte dabei etwas höher sein als sonst. Sie können die Pflanze auch mit einem Langzeitdünger düngen, um sie über einen längeren Zeitraum mit Nährstoffen zu versorgen.

<h2>Zimmerpflanzen richtig düngen: Tipps</h2>

Hier sind einige Tipps, wie Sie Ihre Zimmerpflanzen richtig düngen können:

* Verwenden Sie einen Dünger, der speziell für Zimmerpflanzen geeignet ist.
* Halten Sie sich an die Dosierungsanleitung auf der Verpackung des Düngers.
* Düngen Sie die Pflanzen während der Wachstumsphase alle zwei bis vier Wochen.
* Im Winter sollten die Pflanzen seltener gedüngt werden, etwa alle sechs bis acht Wochen.
* Überdüngen Sie Ihre Pflanzen nicht, da dies zu Verbrennungen führen kann.
* Wenn Sie sich nicht sicher sind, wie viel Dünger Ihre Pflanze benötigt, fragen Sie am besten in einem Fachgeschäft nach.",0

<h1>Banish belly bloat with these tips</h1>

✢ SLOW DOWN YOUR EATING

Take your time at meals and chew each mouthful thoroughly. This helps your body digest food more easily and helps your stomach feel more satisfied.

✢ AVOID GASSY FOODS

Certain foods, such as beans, lentils and broccoli, can cause gas and bloating. If you’re prone to bloating, try limiting your intake of these foods.

✢ DRINK PLENTY OF WATER

Staying hydrated is important for overall health, but it can also help to reduce bloating. Water helps to flush out toxins and keep your digestive system moving smoothly.

✢ GET REGULAR EXERCISE

Regular exercise is a great way to improve your overall health and well-being, and it can also help to reduce bloating. Exercise helps to keep your digestive system moving and can help to reduce stress, which can also be a contributing factor to bloating.

✢ TRY A PROBIOTIC SUPPLEMENT

Probiotics are live bacteria that can help to improve your gut health. Taking a probiotic supplement can help to reduce bloating and other digestive problems.",0

Situation:

Trader sells an item with 600 shop value for 10% over shop value.
Customer also has a 15% savor bonus for that item.
Customer makes an offer for 60% of shop value.

I know it sounds ridiculous, but this is a friend and they are in this situation. I want to make sure they don't get ripped off.

Questions:

1. What is the trader's asking price?

2. What is the customer's offer?

3. What is the maximum discount the trader would be willing to accept?

4. What is the best price the customer could get if they were able to negotiate the best deal possible?

5. What is the difference between the trader's asking price and the best price the customer could get?

6. What is the percentage difference between the trader's asking price and the best price the customer could get?

Answers:

1. 660

2. 360

3. 20%

4. 360

5. 300

6. 45.45%

Explanation:

1. The trader's asking price is 10% over the shop value, which is 600 * 1.10 = 660.

2. The customer's offer is 60% of the shop value, which is 600 * 0.60 = 360.

3. The maximum discount the trader would be willing to accept is 20%, which is 660 * 0.20 = 132.

4. The best price the customer could get if they were able to negotiate the best deal possible is 360, which is the customer's offer.

5. The difference between the trader's asking price and the best price the customer could get is 300, which is 660 - 360.

6. The percentage difference between the trader's asking price and the best price the customer could get is 45.45%, which is (360 - 660) / 660 * 100.

Conclusion:

In this scenario, the trader is asking for a price that is significantly higher than what the customer is willing to pay. The customer should try to negotiate the best price possible, which is 360. This would result in a savings of 300 credits, which is a difference of 45.45% from the trader's asking price.</p>",0

121,121,,,"[('', '')]","<b>Merdeka.com -</b> Seorang bocah laki-laki berusia 11 tahun dari North Carolina, Amerika Serikat, bunuh diri setelah dituduh membobol mobil oleh beberapa polisi. Polisi tersebut menuduh tanpa bukti dan menggeledahnya secara tak patut.

Menurut laporan Time, bocah tersebut, bernama Jaheim McMillan, bunuh diri pada 28 November lalu di kamarnya. Sebelumnya, ia bertemu dengan polisi setempat pada 21 Oktober.

Washington Post melaporkan, <b>polisi</b> mendapatkan laporan dari seorang pekerja yang mengatakan ia melihat seorang Jaheim McMillan sedang mengobrak-abrik sebuah mobil yang terparkir di luar gedung apartemen. Dari empat petugas polisi yang tiba di lokasi, seorang yang paling ngotot menuduhnya dan memintanya menunjukkan isi tasnya.

Jaheim menuruti permintaan polisi tersebut dan menunjukkan isi tasnya. Namun, polisi tersebut tetap menuduhnya dan bahkan menggeledah tasnya tanpa meminta izin. Polisi menemukan sebuah sarung tangan di dalam tas Jaheim, dan itu langsung disebut-sebut sebagai barang bukti. Polisi tersebut mengatakan sarung tangan adalah barang bukti.

""Pencuri memakai sarung tangan, jadi menurutmu apa yang akan dilakukan seorang pencuri di dalam mobil? Mencari sesuatu untuk dicuri,"" kata polisi tersebut.

Jaheim terus-menerus membantah tuduhan tersebut. Ia mengatakan ia hanya mengambil sebuah kotak A&W dari temannya dan memasukkannya ke dalam tasnya. Setelah itu ia duduk di sebuah taman dekat gedung apartemen.

Seorang saksi mengatakan kepada Time dia melihat Jaheim sedang mengambil sesuatu dari mobil, namun ia tidak melihat Jaheim masuk ke dalam mobil. Saksi tersebut mengonfirmasi pernyataan Jaheim bahwa ia sedang duduk di taman.

Polisi juga menuduhnya telah merampok sebuah toko pada beberapa minggu sebelumnya. Jaheim tetap menampik tuduhan tersebut dan mengatakan ia ada di luar kota ketika perampokan terjadi.

Namun, polisi tidak mempercayainya dan memintanya menunjukkannya kata sandi ponselnya untuk memeriksa lokasinya saat kejadian. Jaheim pun terpaksa menuruti permintaan polisi tersebut.

Jaheim pulang ke rumah ibunya dalam keadaan sangat marah. Ia mengaku sangat marah kepada polisi yang menuduhnya melakukan hal-hal yang tidak dilakukannya. Jaheim tidak mau menandatangani surat pelanggaran apa pun dari polisi karena ia merasa tidak melakukan kejahatan.

Seminggu setelah bertemu dengan polisi, Jaheim diwinterview oleh petugas layanan perlindungan anak. Ia menceritakan semua yang terjadi pada hari itu kepada petugas tersebut.

Menurut pengakuan ibu Jaheim, putranya terlihat sangat terganggu sejak kejadian itu. Jaheim tidak mau keluar rumah dan memilih untuk mengurung diri di kamarnya. Ia menolak pergi sekolah dan tidak mau bertemu dengan siapa pun.

Pada tanggal 28 November, ibu Jaheim menemukannya tewas bunuh diri di kamarnya.

""Saya melihat banyak anak yang mendapat masalah, tapi ini adalah tuduhan palsu,"" kata Tiffany McMillan, ibu Jaheim.

Ia mengatakan, meskipun Jaheim memiliki masalah perilaku, ia tidak pernah terlibat masalah dengan hukum sebelumnya.

Pengacara keluarga Jaheim saat ini sedang berusaha untuk mengajukan gugatan kepada departemen <b>kepolisian</b> setempat.

Menurut mereka, polisi tidak memiliki bukti yang cukup untuk menuduh Jaheim melakukan kejahatan. Mereka juga mengatakan polisi seharusnya tidak menggeledah tas Jaheim tanpa izin.

Kepala polisi kota Dunn, Larry Smith, mengatakan polisi yang menangani kasus Jaheim telah diskorsing sampai waktu yang tidak ditentukan. <b>(mdk/pan)</b>

Τότε είναι που ξεκινήσαν οι πρώτες συζητήσεις περί ουσιών που είχαν ήδη υιοθετήσει η νεολαία της Αμερικής, που απαιτούσε ελευθερία και αυτοδιάθεση. Η κυβέρνηση τότε, όπως ήταν αναμενόμενο, άρχισε να περιορίζει την κατανάλωσή τους με την επιβολή κυβερνητικών νόμων.

Ο Πρόεδρος Μπάρυ Γκόλντγουότερ το 1968 είχε να λέει: «<em>Τα ναρκωτικά είναι ένα σοβαρό πρόβλημα που πρέπει να αντιμετωπίσουμε με ισχύ και αποτελεσματικότητα. Η κυβέρνησή μας πρέπει να κάνει ό,τι χρειάζεται για να σταματήσει τη διακίνηση και χρήση ναρκωτικών στα σύνορά μας. Τα ναρκωτικά αποτελούν απειλή για την υγεία των πολιτών μας και την ασφάλεια της χώρας μας. Θα εργαστούμε στοχευμένα και ακούραστα ώστε να καταφέρουμε να τα εξαλείψουμε</em>».

Οι νέοι ήταν ανυπάκουοι και θυμωμένοι και η κυβέρνηση άρχισε να κατακλύζεται από αντιδράσεις. Αμερικάνοι πολίτες συνελήφθησαν, παραπέμφθησαν σε δίκη και εγκλεισμούς, σε μια προσπάθεια εκφοβισμού από την κυβέρνηση ώστε να μειωθεί η ζήτηση των ναρκωτικών. Στην ουσία κανείς δεν ήταν απρόθυμος να αντιμετωπιστεί το πρόβλημα, αλλά υπήρξε μεγάλη έκπληξη όταν ένας ψυχίατρος άρχισε να μιλάει με λιγότερο αυστηρό τόνο.

Ο Λέον Τζερώμ Κάρρ, πιο γνωστός ως Τζέρι Κάρρ, ήταν ένας νεαρός ψυχίατρος που εργαζόταν σε νοσοκομείο του Σαν Φρανσίσκο στα τέλη της δεκαετίας του ’60. Ήταν ένας οραματιστής που πίστευε στην εκπαίδευση και τη θεραπεία ως τρόπους αντιμετώπισης του προβλήματος των ναρκωτικών, πιστεύοντας πως τα υψηλά ποσοστά εγκλήματος και φυλακίσεων δεν ήταν λύσεις, αλλά αποτυχίες της ίδιας της κοινωνίας.

Το 1967 ίδρυσε το πρώτο πρόγραμμα αποτοξίνωσης ναρκωτικών στο Σαν Φρανσίσκο, το Haight-Ashbury Free Clinic, το οποίο παρείχε ιατρικές και ψυχολογικές υπηρεσίες σε χρήστες ναρκωτικών. Το πρόγραμμα έγινε διάσημο παγκοσμίως και ο Κάρρ έγινε γνωστός ως ένας από τους πρωτοπόρους στην αντιμετώπιση του προβλήματος των ναρκωτικών.

Το 1971, ξεκίνησε το πρώτο πρόγραμμα δισθενούς νοσηλείας (prisons-diversion programs) για τους χρήστες ναρκωτικών στο Σαν Φρανσίσκο. Τότε κυκλοφορούσε η ηρωίνη με όνομα «Κινεζική Άνοιξη» (China White) και κάποιοι θυμούνται πως η Μαριν Κάουτνι, το μικρότερο παιδί της γνωστής, τραγικής, φιλανθρωπικής οικογένειας των Κάουτνι (Courtney), ήταν ένα από τα θύματά της. Ήταν μια τραγική υπόθεση που δεν έφυγε ποτέ από τα χείλη των πολιτών της πόλης.

Την κίνηση του Καρρ, αν και με μεγάλη καθυστέρηση, ακολούθησε και ο πρόεδρος Νίξον το 1972, ανακοινώνοντας πως η πολιτική του πολέμου κατά των ναρκωτικών θα αναδιαρθωνόταν και θα ξεκίναγε μια νέα προσέγγιση, η αποτοξίνωση και η στήριξη των θυμάτων των ουσιών, όχι η τιμωρία τους.

Αυτή ήταν η αρχή της ίδρυσης των Κέντρων Ψυχικής Υγείας-Πιλότων (Community Mental Health Pilot Centers), μια προσπάθεια της κυβέρνησης να παράσχει στους χρήστες ναρκωτικών, αλκοολικών και προσφύγων μια ολοκληρωμένη σειρά υπηρεσιών, όπως θεραπεία, συμβουλευτική και εκπαίδευση, σε μια προσπάθεια να τους βοηθήσει να ανακάμψουν.

Όμως, δεν ήταν όλοι σύμφωνοι με αυτή τη νέα προσέγγιση. πολλοί αστυνομικοί και πολιτικοί πίστευαν πως ήταν πολύ επιεικής και πως θα οδηγούσε σε αύξηση της εγκληματικότητας.

Ωστόσο, τα Κέντρα Ψυχικής Υγείας-Πιλότων ήταν μια μεγάλη επιτυχία. Έδωσαν σε χιλιάδες ανθρώπους τη βοήθεια που χρειάζονταν για να ανακάμψουν από τον εθισμό και να ζήσουν υγιεινές και παραγωγικές ζωές.

Ο Κάρρ συνέχισε να εργάζεται στον τομέα της ψυχικής υγείας μέχρι τον θάνατό του το 2003. Το έργο του είχε μεγάλο αντίκτυπο στη ζωή χιλιάδων ανθρώπων και τον θυμούνται ακόμη ως έναν από τους πρωτοπόρους στην αντιμετώπιση του προβλήματος των ναρκωτικών.",0

In the report, the Task Force calls for ""accelerated global deployment of solar, wind, and other clean energy technologies for electricity generation, transportation, heating and cooling of buildings, and industrial processes."" The Task Force also calls for ""increased support for the Clean Technology Fund"" (CTF).

The CTF is a joint trust administered by the World Bank and managed by a multilateral interim trustee composed of representatives from all donor countries. The CTF provides financial and technical assistance to developing countries ""to promote energy access, energy efficiency, and renewable energy"" through investments and technical assistance in renewable energy, energy efficiency, and sustainable transportation. The United States made three contributions to the CTF in 2009 and 2010, totaling US$540 million, and has pledged an additional US$120 million in 2013. The CTF has since been capitalized with US$5.1 billion by 18 bilateral donors and has supported 29 projects in 23 countries.

In May 2013, President Obama announced a new U.S.-Africa Clean Energy Finance Initiative that is intended to raise US$2 billion in combined private and public sector financing to support renewable and clean energy generation and access in sub-Saharan Africa. As part of the initiative, the United States has pledged US$120 million to the CTF.",0

 晚餐 时 我 问 坐 在 对面 的 老婆 

 她 看 了 我 一眼 说 晚餐 做 好 没有 是 什么 

 我 说 做 好 了 

 她 说 那 你 还 不 端 过来 

 这 阵子 她 对 我 不 太 耐烦 因为 一 星期 前 我 辞 了 职 从 互联网 大 厂 离职 

 大家 都 说 互联网 大 厂 是 年轻 人 的 天下 我 也 这么 认为 就算 时不时 也 能 听 到 有人 感慨 三 十 五 岁 以后 不 好 找 工作 可是 我 从 没 想 过 那 是 真 的 

 直到 前段 时间 我 的 项目 组 被 整个 裁 掉 我 才 慌 了 

 慌 了 以后 却 发现 这么 多年 我 啥 也 没 学 到 

 工作 内容 就是 人工 智能 相关 的 每天 就是 用 自己 的 行话 对 着 电脑 胡 侃 根本 不是 什么 实打实 需要 经验 的 技术 活 

 说 实话 这么 多年 我 一直 没 打算 换 工作 毕竟 这 份 工作 待遇 优厚 而且 也 算得 上 体面 也有 机会 假装 是个 人工 智能 专家 

 可是 现在 根本 没 得 选 了 

 这 阵子 我 就 一直 在 投 简历 面试 但是 现实 却 很 骨 感 我 面试 时 发现 哪怕 是 投 一些 人工 智能 的 相关 岗位 也 总 是 被 刷 掉 

 甚至 有 一次 连 面试 的 机会 都 没有 就 被 人事 拒 了 理由 是 我 年纪 太 大 

 那 时 我 简直 不 敢 相信 

 我 甚至 怀疑 人事 在 撒谎 因为 我 看 到 那 家 公司 正在 招 的 算法 工程师 岗位 里 的 年龄 要求 是 三 十 五 岁 以下 

 我 今年 三 十 六 岁 

】

 昨天 晚上 和 老婆 说 起 这 件 事 的 时候 她 说 可能 是 我 的 工作 经验 还 不够 

 我 说 怎么 可能 工作 经验 已经 十 年 了 

 她 说 那 你 怎么 才 升 到 经理 职位 干 了 十 年 还 不如 人家 干 五 年 才 升 上来 的 

 她 说 完 这 句 话 突然 想起 了 什么 停 下 了 吃饭 问 我 那个 晋升 的 项目 你 其实 没 做 什么 对 吗 

 我 沉默 了 一会儿 说 那 是个 团队 合作 项目 嘛 

 她 说 那 当初 升 职 的 评语 里 写 的 团队 管理 领导 力 你 也是 放屁 咯 

 一句 话说 得 我 哑 口 无 言 

 我 之 所以 是个 打工 人 这么 多年 都 没 混 到 高 管 职位 就是 因为 我 没有 这些 能力 

 但是 这 又 能 怪 谁 呢 

 我 一直 以为 自己 在 一步 一个 脚印 地 努力 工作 这 不 就是 打工 人 的 正常 状态 吗 

 就算 偶尔 听 到 关于 社会 阶层 流动 性 的 讨论 也 只 知道 嘴 上 附和 两 句 从 没 太 把 它 当真 

 我 以为 在 大 城市 只要 足够 努力 就 可以 创造 出 比 上 一代 更 好 的 生活 

 但是 我 错 了 

 我 的 父母 是 工人 阶级 我 和 他们 一样 都 是 打工 人 打工 人 的 出路 只有 两 条 要么 一辈子 打工 要么 实现 财务 自由 

 但是 实现 财务 自由 谈何容易 

 它 需要 多少 能力 运气 机会 

 而 这些 东西 是 我 能 控制 的 吗 

 我 不 知道 

 我 只 知道 我 三 十 六 岁 了 工作 经验 十 年 从 学校 毕业 时 兴致 勃勃 地 一头 扎 进 了 互联网 现在 十 年 过去 了 却 突然 发现 自己 什么 都 没 学 到 

 我 不 知道 我 还 能 做 什么 

 也 不 知道 该 怎样 面 对 未来 

 如果 现实 不 放 过 打工 人 那 作为 打工 人 的 我 该 何去何从 

 我 和 老婆 结婚 十 年 了 这 十 年 虽然 也 没 怎么 攒 下 钱 现在 却 依旧 要 为了 柴米油盐 发愁 

 每天 晚上 我们 依旧 要 精打细算 地 计算 着 开支 商量 着 如何 在 每 个 月 的 工资 里 省 出 一点 钱 存 起来 

 我 不 愿意 让 老婆 过 这样 的 生活 

 我 还 想 继续 努力 工作 给 老婆 一个 更 好 的 生活 

 可是 我 还 能 做 什么 呢 

 我 三 十 六 岁 了 以后 的 人生 该 何去何从 

 我 真 的 不 知道 

 或许 我 只 能 像 我 父母 一样 一辈子 打工 了 吧 

 可是 那样 的 生活 真 的 是 我 想 要 的 吗 

 我 真 的 甘心 吗 

 我 不 甘心 

 我 想 改变 我 的 人生 

 我 想 给 老婆 一个 更 好 的 生活 

 我 想 让 自己 的 人生 更 有 意义 

 可是 我 该 怎么 做 呢

Sterling owned the Clippers for more than 30 years, but his tenure was marred by controversy. In 2014, he was recorded making racist remarks about African Americans, which led to him being banned from the NBA for life.

I've found a solution for this.

In the BIOS/UEFI settings, there is a setting called ""USB Controller Mode"". This setting is set to ""AHCI"" by default. Change this setting to ""XHCI"".

After doing this, USB devices will start working in Linux.

On Feb. 13th, the president of the African Development Bank (AfDB), Akinwumi Adesina, met with the president of the Export-Import Bank of China (China Exim), Hu Xiaolian. The two organizations signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to strengthen their partnership in co-financing projects in Africa. The MOU covers infrastructure, agriculture, clean energy, digitalization and the private sector in particular.

Analysis

The partnership is expected to increase the resources available to fund Africa's long-term economic and social development. The AfDB stated that it will use its experience in understanding Africa's development environment to screen and select projects for co-financing, while China Exim will bring its funding capacity, long-term credit facilities and strong global presence to the table. The agreement reflects China's commitment to supporting African countries' economic and social development as well as the increasing importance of the China-Africa economic relationship in recent years. 

China has become Africa's largest trading partner, and its share in Africa's total trade increased from 11% in 2000 to 23% in 2017. China also became a major investor in Africa, with Chinese foreign direct investment (FDI) in Africa increasing from US$75m in 2003 to US$40bn in 2017, accounting for about 20% of total FDI in Africa. 

One of the key areas of cooperation between China and Africa has been in infrastructure development. China Exim has been a major financier of infrastructure projects in Africa, such as the Ethiopia-Djibouti Railway, the Mombasa Standard Gauge Railway, and the new international terminal at Ngqura Port in South Africa. The bank has also provided financing for projects in the energy sector, such as the construction of the Grand Inga Dam in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which will be the largest hydroelectric power plant in the world when it is completed.

The agreement between the AfDB and China Exim is likely to further boost China-Africa cooperation in infrastructure development. The two institutions will work together to identify and co-finance projects that will have a positive impact on economic growth and social development in Africa. They will also work to promote the use of innovative financing mechanisms, such as public-private partnerships, to attract private sector investment in infrastructure projects.

The partnership between the AfDB and China Exim is also expected to help promote the development of Africa's private sector. The AfDB and China Exim will work together to provide financial and technical support to African businesses, and to promote the participation of African businesses in regional and global value chains. They will also work to improve the investment climate in Africa, and to encourage Chinese companies to invest in Africa.

Impact on the forecast

The deal between the AfDB and China Exim is positive for our forecast for African economic growth. The additional resources that will be available for infrastructure development and private sector development will help to boost economic growth over the next few years. The deal is also positive for our forecast for China's economic growth, as it will help to boost exports and create jobs in China.

Our current forecast for Africa's real GDP growth is 3.8% in 2021 and 4.1% in 2022. We expect the deal between the AfDB and China Exim to support stronger growth in African economies. We may revise up our growth forecast for Africa in the near future. 

<start_of_image> for economic growth. We will monitor the implementation of the MOU and adjust our forecasts accordingly.

<start_of_image>Details of China Exim-AfDB MOU

<start_of_image> in Africa:

* The objective of the MOU is for both institutions to collaborate in promoting sustainable economic and social development in Africa through jointly financing projects.

  * Promotion of capacity building and knowledge transfer

* The MOU will also enable both institutions to work together in promoting policy and regulatory frameworks that are conducive to attracting private sector investment in Africa.

* The two institutions will also explore opportunities for co-financing projects under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which is a major Chinese initiative to promote infrastructure development and economic cooperation between China and other countries. The MOU will facilitate collaboration between the AfDB and China Exim in identifying, preparing, and financing projects under the BRI in Africa.",0

I’m in my mid 20s, live in the US, and have always been in decent health. No underlying health conditions and up until a few months ago, I’ve always been able to eat whatever I want with no problems.

Around October, I started developing these odd symptoms. Honestly I can’t say for sure if they’re all connected; they could be separate issues but I’m not sure. The most prominent and concerning symptom is this sensation of burning/tingling in my left chest, just beneath my breast. I can feel it pretty much all day and it gets worse when I lie down or move that arm around too much. I also have headaches throughout the day that range from mild to moderate. They can last anywhere from an hour or two to all day. My sex drive is nearly nonexistent, my periods are way heavier/more painful/longer than before, and I have this weird sensation of pulsating in my left hip bone/pelvic area. I found a weird red/brown birthmark-looking thing on my arm that I think is new and I feel like my skin is generally more sensitive than normal. Lastly, I have a feeling of faintness/dizziness especially when I bend over or stand up. And I feel like I’ve lost some weight and muscle tone even though I haven’t changed anything about my diet or activity level.

I’ve gone to the doctor twice and they’ve run about 20 blood tests (including mammogram, chest xray, ekg, and glucose/thyroid tests). They’ve come back negative so my doctor said it’s probably anxiety. They prescribed meds but I’m honestly skeptical that’s the issue as I feel mostly fine psychologically. I’ve also been having pretty bad constipation lately, which I think might be connected to this somehow.

I’m just really worried because these symptoms don’t feel right to me and I’m not sure how else to advocate for myself. I want to go back to the doctor but don’t know what to say, what to ask for, or how to convince them to take me seriously.

Any advice or words of encouragement would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.</p>

<blockquote id=""1"" pid=""0"" uid=""1"">I would ask to be seen by a rheumatologist to rule out an autoimmune disease. Autoimmune diseases can cause a wide range of symptoms, including fatigue, pain, and skin problems. Your constellation of symptoms is suspicious for an autoimmune disorder, and a rheumatologist would be able to order the appropriate tests to diagnose or rule out this possibility.</blockquote>

<blockquote id=""2"" pid=""0"" uid=""2"">I'm sorry you are going through this. I can't offer any medical advice, but I can say that I understand how frustrating and scary it can be to have unexplained symptoms.

I would recommend keeping a detailed journal of your symptoms, including when they occur, how severe they are, and anything else you think might be relevant. This will help your doctor track your progress and identify any patterns in your symptoms.

It may also be helpful to get a second opinion from another doctor. Sometimes, a fresh set of eyes can help identify something that the first doctor missed.

Remember, you are not alone. There are many people who have experienced unexplained symptoms, and there is help available. Don't give up on yourself. Keep advocating for yourself and keep looking for answers.</blockquote>

<blockquote id=""3"" pid=""0"" uid=""3"">I would go to a different doctor and ask about your symptoms again. It's important to advocate for yourself and get the care you need. You could also try keeping a log of your symptoms to see if there's a pattern.</blockquote>

<blockquote id=""4"" pid=""0"" uid=""4"">Could you be pregnant?</blockquote>

<blockquote id=""5"" pid=""0"" uid=""5"">I would find a new doctor. I'm not saying it's anything serious, but your symptoms definitely warrant further investigation. You might have to be your own advocate and push for more tests and referrals.</blockquote>

<blockquote id=""6"" pid=""0"" uid=""6"">I'm sorry to hear that you're going through this. It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of different symptoms, and it can be difficult to know where to start.

One thing I would suggest is to keep a journal of your symptoms. This can help you track how they're changing over time, and it can also help your doctor identify any patterns or trends.

I would also recommend getting a second opinion from another doctor. Sometimes, a fresh set of eyes can help identify something that the first doctor missed.

In the meantime, there are a few things you can do to help manage your symptoms. For example, if you're experiencing headaches, you can try taking over-the-counter pain relievers or using a cold compress. If you're constipated, you can try eating more fiber or taking a stool softener.

I know this is a lot to take in, and it can be overwhelming. But I want you to know that there are people who can help you. Your doctor is there to help you figure out what's going on and get you the treatment you need. And there are also online resources and support groups where you can connect with other people who are going through similar experiences.

Please don't give up on yourself. You deserve to feel better, and there are people who can help you get there.</blockquote>",0

<strong>NB!</strong> Husk at dette er <strong>ikke</strong> noe gjengivelse av den aktuelle kampen, men en helt ny historie med et nytt plot.

I et avgjørende oppgjør på Nadderud sto mye på spill da Stabæk og Molde møttes til kamp. På forhånd var det knyttet stor spenning til duellen mellom to av Eliteseriens beste lag denne sesongen.

Begge lagene startet kampen med høyt tempo, og det gikk ikke lang tid før den første sjansen kom. Et frispark i en gunstig posisjon for Molde førte til hodeball i feltet, men Stabæks keeper Anders Lie reddet sikkert.

I det 15. minutt fikk Stabæk en stor mulighet da Tobias Børkeeiet kom seg løs på høyrekanten og sendte inn et hardt innlegg. Thomas Lehne Olsen fikk hodet på ballen, men klarte ikke å styre den inn i mål.

Molde fortsatte å skape farligheter foran Stabæks mål, og etter 25 minutter fikk de uttelling. Magnus Wolff Eikrem slo en nydelig corner, og Eirik Ulland Andersen steg til værs og headet ballen i mål.

Stabæk prøvde å svare umiddelbart, og bare noen minutter senere hadde de en god sjanse. Et innlegg fra Markus Johnsen fant Filip Hornberg, men avslutningen hans ble reddet av Andreas Linde i Moldes mål.

Etter hvilen fortsatte kampen i samme høye tempo. Begge lag hadde sine sjanser, men det var Molde som var nærmest scoring da Etzaz Hussain traff metallet med et langskudd etter 65 minutter.

Mot slutten av kampen presset Stabæk på for utligning, men Molde-forsvaret stod imot. I det 89. minutt fikk Stabæk en siste sjanse da de fikk frispark på kanten av 16-meteren. Frisparket ble slått inn i feltet, men headingen fra Stabæk-spillerne gikk rett i hendene på Andreas Linde.

Dermed endte kampen 1-0 til Molde, som dermed tok et viktig skritt mot seriegullet. Stabæk på sin side, må nå kjempe for å holde seg i toppen av tabellen.

Jeg håper dere likte sammendraget av kampen. Jeg vil gjerne legge til at dette kun er ment som en morsom måte å dele kampreferater på, og at det ikke er ment å være en nøyaktig gjengivelse av den aktuelle kampen.",0

Terrain data is used to:

* Plan for and respond to natural hazards, such as floods, droughts, and wildfires
* Manage water resources, such as rivers, lakes, and aquifers
* Protect and restore ecosystems, such as forests, wetlands, and coral reefs
* Plan for and develop sustainable land use practices, such as agriculture, forestry, and mining
* Adapt to climate change, such as sea level rise and changes in precipitation patterns

Terrain data is essential for understanding the Earth's surface and how it is changing over time. It helps us to make informed decisions about how to use and manage our natural resources and how to adapt to the impacts of climate change.

There are many different ways to collect terrain data. Some of the most common methods include:

* Aerial photography
* Satellite imagery
* Lidar (Light Detection and Ranging)
* Ground-based surveys

Once terrain data has been collected, it can be used to create a variety of different products, such as:

* Topographic maps
* Digital elevation models (DEMs)
* Land use maps
* Watershed boundary maps
* Flood hazard maps

The possibility of using two interconnected sources of light, specifically a conventional laser and a laser diode with mutually perpendicular polarization, to excite two photon transitions in an atomic system is analyzed. The matrix elements of the Hamiltonian of the interaction of atoms with the radiation field in the second order of perturbation theory are calculated. Expressions are obtained for the probabilities of the corresponding two-photon transitions. It is shown that the two-photon excitation transitions occur more efficiently at certain ratios of the intensities of two laser radiators, which are calculated for each transition.",0

* This file implements the Pavlov's dog experiment as a QV-based application.
* The application uses only one state machine QF_Pavlov for both the experiment
* and the event-driven code.
*
* Pavlov's dog experiment is described in [1]. Pavlov's theory of conditioned
* reflexes is based on the following scheme:
*
* (1) Unconditioned stimulus:     food
* (2) Unconditioned response:    salivation
* (3) Conditioned stimulus:       bell
* (4) Conditioned response:      salivation
*
* Neutral signals, like the sound of a bell, do not elicit any specific reaction,
* but when they are associated with some significant stimuli, such as the food,
* they eventually come to elicit the same reaction as the significant
* stimulus, even when the significant stimulus is removed.
*
* The QF_Pavlov state machine represents the experiment as follows:
*
* - The event eCAL (ringing the bell) is the stimulus (both conditioned and
* unconditioned).
* - The event eFOOD (giving food to the dog) is the unconditioned response.
* - The event eHungry (the dog is hungry) is considered to be a neutral signal.
* - The event eSALIV (salivation) is the conditioned response.
*
* In the state HUNGRY, the event eHungry causes a transition to the state HUNGRY_1.
* The transition from HUNGRY_1 to HUNGRY_2 happens automatically after a
* timeout.
* When hungry and the bell rings (eCAL), the dog salivates (eSALIV) and goes to the
* state WAITING. In the state WAITING, if the hungry dog receives some food
* (eFOOD), the dog salivates again, but this time it goes to the state FULL.
* If the hungry dog does not receive some food (neither eFOOD nor eCAL in the state
* WAITING), the dog stays hungry and goes to the state HUNGRY_2.
*
* If the dog is not hungry (in the state FULL), the sound of the bell (eCAL) does
* not cause a salivation (no eSALIV), and the dog stays in the state FULL.
* If the dog is full and some food is given to it (eFOOD), the dog salivates
* and goes back to the state HUNGRY.

147,147,,,"[('', '')]","电视剧《鼓楼外》正在东方卫视热播，该剧由袁姗姗、刘奕君、翟天临、菅纫姿等主演，讲述了20世纪20年代，北平城内鼓楼外小小茶社里，一群为了梦想在北平城里摸索打拼的年轻人，演绎了一段青春励志故事。

　　《鼓楼外》以“青年奋斗”的视角，将民国北平作为舞台。小人物的成长历程、追梦过程成为电视剧一部很大的依托。

　　在电视剧中，袁姗姗饰演的关小关认为过去的自己是两个字“缺心眼”。而此次的饰演经历，她希望关小关这个角色能给自己带来全新的体验，“她有自己的理想，勇于反抗自己的家庭，对于我们现在年轻人来说有很大的激励。”

　　此前《大江大河》的热播也引起了对于“青年一代”的讨论，有观众表示，这一代年轻人能够在电视剧中看到自己的影子，同样有网友表示，看到剧中主角的经历，感觉到对于自己现实生活的一种反思。

　　在《鼓楼外》中，袁姗姗饰演的关小关是一个爱幻想且敢做敢爱的文艺女青年，关小关将文学和现实生活进行比较，把生活美好的一面对比现实黑暗的一面。袁姗姗认为，“在关小关身上有一种理想主义的色彩”。

　　除了主演袁姗姗之外，《鼓楼外》的另一大看点便是导演姚远。

　　执导过《灵魂摆渡》《河神》等剧的导演姚远可以说是一名“鬼才导演”，他所擅长的悬疑剧深受观众喜爱。虽然《鼓楼外》是一部平民背景下的青春励志剧，但观众仍旧希望姚远能在剧中发挥自己的“鬼才”优势，加入一些悬疑元素。

　　在该剧的剧情中，就有这样一个看点：郑家和刘家是世代交好的两家人，直到郑家开茶社后，两家关系急剧恶化。从郑家、刘家的关系判断，两家应该势均力敌。但在刘家展现的茶馆中，刘家茶馆的华美和气派令人咋舌。单单从装潢上就能感觉到两家的巨大差距。

　　在电视剧中，刘金龙的爷爷刘顺福曾经是郑家的掌柜，如果当初刘顺福没有离开郑家，郑家茶社的装潢会不会和刘家一样华贵气派呢？或者说，是不是因为刘顺福的离开，导致郑家茶社迅速没落呢？如此，刘家茶社又有什么秘密呢？

　　观众还期待《鼓楼外》在反转方面的处理方式，姚远的《灵魂摆渡》中出现过很多反转的情节，《河神》中的反转也让观众眼花缭乱。明明已经认定的小反派，在下一秒就变成了大反派。不知道《鼓楼外》是否会有类似的反转情节呢？

　　在电视剧中，袁姗姗饰演的关小关和翟天临饰演的黎绍峰联手创业，和刘奕君饰演的退伍军人郑大兴郑家巷内开展北平城新生活，要带着各自喜欢的年轻人去北漂，他们将面临诸多困难和挑战。

　　具体会有哪些挑战，我们还需拭目以待。",0

Easily defended, the castle forms part of a chain of fortifications which stretched along the Clariano River and aimed to prevent access to the valley of Albaida from the Iruela mountains. The castle of Agres is one of three fortifications located in the localities of Agres, Biar, and Benejama, which, together with the castle of Castalla, formed in the 12th and 13th centuries a defensive system protecting the valley of Albaida.

The castle was built by Muslims in the 11th century. It is one of the best preserved castles in the Valencian Community. The castle is located on a cliff overlooking the town of Agres. It is a walled enclosure with four towers and a gatehouse. The keep is located in the center of the enclosure and it is a rectangular tower with three floors. The castle is built of masonry and it is in good condition.

The castle of Agres is a historical monument and it is a tourist attraction. It is open to the public and it can be visited for free. The castle is also a venue for cultural events and it is used for concerts, exhibitions, and other events.",0

Direct zoonosis occurs when the infectious agent is transmitted from an animal to a human, such as through a bite, scratch, or contact with the animal's saliva, blood, or other bodily fluids. Indirect zoonosis occurs when the infectious agent is transmitted from an animal to a human through an intermediate host, such as a mosquito, tick, or flea.

There are many different types of zoonoses, including:

* Bacterial infections, such as salmonella, E. coli, and Lyme disease
* Viral infections, such as rabies, flu, and HIV
* Parasitic infections, such as malaria, hookworm, and tapeworm
* Fungal infections, such as ringworm and histoplasmosis

Zoonoses can cause a wide range of symptoms, depending on the specific infection. Some zoonoses can be mild, while others can be serious or even fatal.

Zoonoses are a public health concern because they can be transmitted from animals to humans, and they can cause a variety of diseases. As a result, it is important to take steps to prevent the spread of zoonoses. These steps include:

* Washing hands frequently with soap and water
* Avoiding contact with animals that are sick or appear to be sick
* Cooking meat and fish thoroughly
* Using insect repellent and wearing protective clothing when in areas where there are mosquitoes, ticks, or fleas
* Getting vaccinated against certain zoonoses, such as rabies and flu

Zoonoses are a serious public health concern, but they can be prevented. By taking steps to prevent the spread of zoonoses, we can help to keep ourselves and our loved ones healthy.

154,154,,,"[('', '')]","While the current bull market, which started in March 2009, is not yet a record breaker, data show that it has been one of the most reliable opportunities for investors to make money during a bull market rally. According to a study by Bespoke Investment Group, the S&P 500 has posted a positive return in 92.5% of all trading days during this bull market. This means that if an investor had bought the S&P 500 at the start of the bull market and held on to it, chances are they would have experienced a positive return in their investment.

The S&P 500 has also posted strong gains during this bull market. The index has risen by 315% since March 2009, which means that an investor who invested $10,000 in the S&P 500 at the start of the bull market would now have $41,500. This is a much stronger return than what investors would have earned if they had invested in fixed income securities, such as bonds.

Of course, there have been some periods of volatility during this bull market. The S&P 500 has had three corrections of at least 10% since March 2009. However, these corrections have been relatively short-lived, and the index has always rebounded to new highs.

Overall, the current bull market has been a great opportunity for investors to make money. The S&P 500 has posted strong gains, and there have been very few periods of volatility. If you are looking for a way to grow your wealth, investing in the stock market during a bull market rally is a good option to consider.

Here are some tips for investing in the stock market during a bull market rally:

* Choose strong stocks. Not all stocks will benefit from a bull market rally. Focus on companies with strong fundamentals, such as earnings growth and a strong balance sheet.
* Diversify your portfolio. Don't put all of your eggs in one basket. Diversify your portfolio by investing in a variety of stocks, sectors, and asset classes. This will help to protect your portfolio from losses if one or more of your investments performs poorly.
* Don't try to time the market. It is impossible to predict when the bull market will end. Trying to time the market can lead to missed opportunities and losses. Instead, focus on staying invested for the long term.
* Rebalance your portfolio regularly. As your investments grow, it is important to rebalance your portfolio to ensure that it is still aligned with your investment goals. This means selling some of your winners and buying more of your losers.
* Don't panic. There will be times when the stock market experiences volatility. However, it is important to remember that bull markets are cyclical. They eventually end, but they always come back. If you panic and sell your stocks during a market downturn, you could miss out on the opportunity to make up your losses when the market recovers.",0

Pour la ministre de la Justice, l’adoption du Plan national de développement économique et social (PNDES) pour la période 2016-2020, le 18 février 2016, s’est imposée comme une nécessité pour poser les bases d’un développement inclusif et durable afin de lutter contre la corruption. Le gouvernement a décidé d’axer ses actions sur l’institutionnalisation de bonnes pratiques en matière de promotion de l’intégrité ; la prévention de la corruption ; et la répression de la corruption.

En vue de créer un environnement institutionnel propice à la lutte contre la corruption, il est nécessaire de renforcer la participation de la société civile au processus de prise de décision et à l’élaboration des politiques. « L’Association Burkinabè des Auditeurs Internes (ABAI) qui a manifesté sa volonté de soutenir le gouvernement dans sa politique de lutte contre la corruption mérite non seulement d’être félicitée, mais aussi d’être encouragée, accompagnée et soutenue », a-t-elle laissé entendre.

La loi n°084-2015/CNT du 03 novembre 2015 définissant le cadre institutionnel de coordination de la lutte contre la corruption et les infractions assimilées, selon elle, a institué un Haut Conseil pour la Réconciliation et l’Unité Nationale (HCRUN) et un Pôle Judiciaire Spécialisé dans le Traitement des Infractions Economiques et Financières (PJ/SPITIEF).

Pour renforcer les systèmes d’intégrité, a-t-elle indiqué, le gouvernement s’attelle à la promotion des valeurs éthiques et de l’intégrité dans les institutions publiques : « Le code de conduite des agents publics a déjà fait l’objet d’un décret et est en voie d’être promulgué en loi. Il en est de même du projet de loi portant statut de l’agent public au Burkina Faso ».

« Un mécanisme a été adopté pour la protection des dénonciateurs d’actes de corruption. Ce mécanisme est en voie d’être amélioré à l’effet de garantir aux dénonciateurs une meilleure protection. Des contrats modèles ont été élaborés à l’usage des acteurs chargés de la passation des marchés publics », a-t-elle ajouté.

Sur le plan préventif, deux actes majeurs ont été posés. Il s’agit de la mise en œuvre de la Stratégie nationale de bonne gouvernance et de lutte contre la corruption (SNBG-LCC) qui a pour objectif de prévenir la corruption et de promouvoir la bonne gouvernance, et l’opérationnalisation du Bureau National de Lutte Contre la Fraude (BUNACOF).

Concernant la répression, le gouvernement s’est engagé à détecter, enquêter et poursuivre les personnes suspectées d’avoir commis des actes de corruption.

Les magistrats ne sont pas exemptés de la lutte contre la corruption. A cet effet, a-t-elle déclaré, « une stratégie visant à prévenir et combattre la corruption au sein de la magistrature a été adoptée et est en cours de mise en œuvre ».

A l’évidence, de nombreux efforts ont été consentis par le gouvernement burkinabè dans son combat contre la corruption. Toutefois, d’autres actions s’imposent à tous les niveaux encore pour parvenir à des résultats satisfaisants.

I'm trying to implement the KNN algorithm. To do this, I need to compute the distance matrix. However, when i run the following code:

<code>sigma_distance = np.empty((n_points, n_points))
for i in range(n_points):
    for j in range(n_points):
        sigma_distance[i, j] = compute_distance(inputs[i], inputs[j])
model.distance_matrix = sigma_distance
</code>

I get the following error:

165,165,,,"[('', '')]","She said, “I give you the right to go ahead and do it.”

A close friend, Victoria Kleber, did just that. Kleber, 27, went ahead and implanted one of the first batches of the AlloStem system — made entirely from donor tissue — into a 68-year-old patient with heart failure. The procedure took place in February at the Texas Heart Institute in Houston.

The patient did well in the short term, Kleber said.

“The heart got smaller, the ejection fraction went up,” she said, meaning the heart performed better and was able to pump more blood. “But we couldn’t tell how much was patient variation and how much was the treatment.”

At the six-month follow-up, the patient had died, though not from any problem stemming from the treatment, Kleber said.

The treatment is still experimental, and scientists don’t yet know whether it could help patients in the long term. The idea behind AlloStem is to replace damaged heart tissue with healthy tissue that can grow and function properly.

In theory, it’s a good concept, said Dr. Charles Murry, director of the Institute for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine at the University of Washington. But it’s been difficult to develop safe and effective stem cell treatments for heart disease, he added.

“The heart is a ridiculously complex organ,” he said. “It’s got billions of cells in it, it’s got all sorts of different compartments. And it’s very difficult to create a stem cell-based intervention that will regenerate all of the different types of cells you need to make the heart work properly.”

Researchers have been trying to develop stem cell therapies for heart disease for more than two decades. Several clinical trials have shown that injecting stem cells into the heart can improve cardiac function, but the results have been inconsistent. In some cases, the stem cells have died or formed tumors.

AlloStem’s technology uses a different approach. Instead of injecting stem cells directly into the heart, the system is designed to create a scaffold that supports the growth of new heart tissue. The scaffold is made from a biocompatible material that is seeded with stem cells. The stem cells are then stimulated to differentiate into cardiomyocytes, the cells that make up the heart muscle.

In laboratory tests, AlloStem’s system has been shown to create functional heart tissue that can contract and pump blood. The system has also been shown to be safe in animal studies.

Kleber said the AlloStem system has the potential to be a major breakthrough in the treatment of heart disease. If the system is successful, it could offer a new way to treat patients who are currently ineligible for heart transplantation.

“We’d be able to offer this treatment to people who are too old or too sick for surgery,” she said. “It would be a game-changer.”

Researchers are still conducting clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AlloStem’s system. If the trials are successful, the system could be approved for clinical use within the next few years.",0

“Pendidikan politik ini sangat penting untuk dilakukan, karena dapat menciptakan warga negara yang aktif dan sadar akan hak dan kewajibannya sebagai warga negara,” kata Cecep.

Selain itu, lanjut Cecep, pendidikan politik juga dapat menumbuhkan kesadaran masyarakat dalam berpartisipasi aktif dalam pembangunan daerah. “Saya berharap, dengan pendidikan politik ini masyarakat Subang semakin sadar dan aktif dalam berpartisipasi aktif membangun daerahnya,” ujarnya.

Cecep menuturkan, bahwa salah satu upaya Pemkab Subang untuk meningkatkan pendidikan politik di masyarakat, yakni dengan melakukan berbagai kegiatan, seperti pelatihan kepemimpinan pemuda, pelatihan kader partai politik, dan diskusi-diskusi politik.

Salah satu program Bupati dan Wakil Bupati Subang, H. Ruhimat dan Agus Masykur Rosyadi adalah menyediakan ruang kepada masyarakat untuk bisa mendapatkan pengajaran ilmu politik. Ruang-ruang tersebut antara lain melalui kegiatan Pancasila, UUD 45, NKRI dan Bhinneka Tunggal Ika yang diwujudkan dalam pendidikan politik melalui kerja sama antara Badan Kesatuan Bangsa dan Politik (Bakesbangpol) dengan 20 universitas atau perguruan tinggi di Kabupaten Subang.

Selain itu, Pemkab Subang juga telah membentuk Pusat Kajian Pancasila dan Demokrasi (PKPD) di Universitas Subang. “PKPD ini merupakan salah satu upaya Pemkab Subang untuk meningkatkan kualitas pendidikan politik di masyarakat,” terangnya.

Cecep berharap, PKPD ini dapat menjadi pusat kajian dan informasi tentang Pancasila dan demokrasi, serta dapat menjadi wadah bagi para akademisi dan masyarakat untuk berdiskusi tentang berbagai persoalan politik.

Vehicle: 2004 Rubicon
Mileage: 71,000
Tires: 33x12.5r15 Goodyear MT/Rs
Modifications:
-4:56 gears
-ARB air locker in the rear
-5.5lb spacer lift in the front, 1.5lb spacer lift in the rear

-Champion Truck Plugs
-Magnecor plug wires
-NGK plug wires (secondary set)
-Stant Super Coolant
-Autolite Alternator
-Optima Yellow Top Battery

I also keep my air filter clean, fill my tires to 32 psi, and try to keep my speed down on the highway (usually 65-70).

I generally live in Oregon, where the elevation is 269 feet.

I've gotten my best mileage at 14.8 mpg on a trip from Portland, Oregon to San Francisco, California. This was heading southbound, so I didn't have to drive up any major mountain passes. Driving back, I got 12.5 mpg, fighting a 45 mph headwind the whole way up the coast and driving over the Grapevine pass. My average highway mileage is around 13.5 mpg.

In the city, I'm getting around 10-11 mpg, depending on how much traffic I'm in.

It seems to me like I'm getting worse mileage than I should be, especially since I've made a bunch of modifications that are supposed to improve fuel economy.

Any ideas on what's causing my poor mileage? Am I missing something important?",0

181,181,,,"[('', '')]","<h1>DB2 Data Propagation for File Transfer Protocol (FTP)</h1>
<h2>DB2 Data Propagation for File Transfer Protocol (FTP) Overview</h2>

DB2® Data Propagation for File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is an MQ Connect extension that provides unidirectional replication of data from DB2 for z/OS® to target systems through FTP.

Data propagation is a high-performance, low-latency, change data capture (CDC) technology that is used to replicate data to multiple destinations in near real time, using the DB2 CDC subsystem to capture changes. Data propagation can significantly reduce the time required to refresh data and can offer multiple benefits, including:

* Reduced bandwidth requirements
* Increased data security
* Improved data reliability and operational efficiency
* Optimized resource utilization

In this solution, DB2 Data Propagation for FTP is used to replicate data, including both table and LOB data, from a source system to target systems that are located on different servers or in different data centers that are connected through FTP. The data propagation technology includes a high-performance data transfer engine that optimizes data transmission, minimizes network overhead, and ensures faster replication.

The following diagram shows the solution architecture:

The solution includes the following components:

<h3>DB2 for z/OS</h3>

DB2 for z/OS is an enterprise-class relational database management system that provides a wide range of capabilities for managing and processing business data, including:

* Transaction processing
* Data warehousing
* Business intelligence
* Advanced analytics

<h3>MQ Connect</h3>

MQ Connect is a suite of products that provides a comprehensive set of capabilities for connecting applications, data, and services across hybrid infrastructures. MQ Connect includes the following components:

* <strong>MQ Connection Manager (MCM)</strong>: A lightweight connectivity solution that provides a secure and reliable way to connect applications to messaging systems.
* <strong>MQ Messaging Gateway (MMG)</strong>: A high-performance messaging gateway that enables applications to send and receive messages using a variety of protocols, such as JMS, AMQP, MQTT, and WebSockets.
* <strong>MQ Telemetry Transport (MQTT) Gateway (MQGW)</strong>: Provides support for the MQTT protocol, which is a popular connectivity protocol for IoT devices and applications.
* <strong>MQ Capture</strong>: A change data capture solution that enables the replication of data from source systems to target systems in near real time.
* <strong>MQ Managed File Transfer (MFT)</strong>: A secure, enterprise-grade file transfer solution that supports a wide range of protocols and provides advanced file transfer capabilities, such as file compression, encryption, and audit logging.

<h3>IBM® Z® Communications Server (ZCS) for File Transfer Protocol (FTP)</h3>

IBM® Z® Communications Server for File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a robust, easy-to-use FTP server that provides secure, high-speed access to files on IBM® z/OS systems.

<h3>MQ Capture CDC Plugin for DB2 for z/OS</h3>

The MQ Capture CDC Plugin for DB2 for z/OS is a software component that enables MQ Capture to capture changes from DB2 for z/OS tables and replicate the changes to target systems.

<h3>Source and target systems</h3>

The source system is the system that contains the data that will be replicated to the target systems. The target systems are the systems that will receive and store the replicated data. In this solution, the source system is a DB2 for z/OS system, and the target systems can be a variety of systems, such as DB2 for z/OS, DB2 for Linux, UNIX and Windows, or a system that uses a different database, such as Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, or SAP Hana.

<h3>FTP server</h3>

The FTP server is a software component that provides file transfer services. In this solution, the FTP server is located on the z/OS system.

<h2>Benefits of DB2 Data Propagation for FTP</h2>

DB2 Data Propagation for FTP provides the following benefits:

* <strong>High performance and low latency</strong>: The data propagation technology includes a high-performance data transfer engine that optimizes data transmission, minimizes network overhead, and ensures faster replication.
* <strong>Reduced bandwidth requirements</strong>: Data propagation uses an efficient data transfer format that reduces the amount of data that is transferred over the network.
* <strong>Increased data security</strong>: Data propagation uses secure protocols to transfer data between the source and target systems.
* <strong>Improved data reliability and operational efficiency</strong>: Data propagation provides reliable data delivery and can help to improve operational efficiency by reducing the time required to refresh data.
* <strong>Optimized resource utilization</strong>: Data propagation can help to optimize resource utilization by reducing the load on the source system and the target systems.

<h2>Use cases for DB2 Data Propagation for FTP</h2>

DB2 Data Propagation for FTP can be used in a variety of scenarios, including:

* <strong>Data warehousing</strong>: Data propagation can be used to replicate data from a DB2 for z/OS system to a data warehouse for reporting and analysis.
* <strong>Business intelligence</strong>: Data propagation can be used to replicate data from a DB2 for z/OS system to a business intelligence platform for reporting and analysis.
* <strong>Application integration</strong>: Data propagation can be used to replicate data from a DB2 for z/OS system to other applications for use in various business processes.
* <strong>Disaster recovery</strong>: Data propagation can be used to replicate data from a DB2 for z/OS system to a disaster recovery site for protection against data loss.
* <strong>Data migration</strong>: Data propagation can be used to migrate data from a DB2 for z/OS system to a different system, such as a DB2 for Linux, UNIX and Windows system, a DB2 for z/OS system on a different server, or a system that uses a different database.

好，你说。叶凌天点头问道。莫凡一直没放松对目标的盯防。但就在此时，距离熔岩两三步的边沿，百花绽放。兴欣两个就这么居高临下对付起了森罗。而森罗也终于荣耀地迎来了他的死亡之门。但是比起玄奇，七点五分的话，向来挺自信的义斩那边，楼冠宁却越来越是疑虑了。这事并不只是对义斩战队来说很重要，对兴欣战队同样重要。这战队的再度加盟，对于兴欣战队来说也是一个很大的提升。尤其在团队赛中，兴欣11个人的阵容，比起常规赛的九人要补强不少，这顿时让关榕飞的计划有了更多的可用性。‘为什么不走我卡了吗’叶凌天让司机开着车，带着李雨欣沿着整个三黄岛走了一圈，李雨欣一直都是认真地看着，看着这么多的建设几乎是连说话的时间都没有。

抱着这样的想法，他走到了二楼的最拐角的位置。我开始了，一个屋子一个屋子的检查，别想蹑手蹑脚的摸到我身后，就你一个。妹子，我保证，我不会打死你！谁会胜谁会败收拾完毕两人各回各家了。叶修乘这掩护的功夫又已经岩之浪人奥磐追踪上了，这货在刚才混战中丢了仇恨，但现在被叶修接手倒也快追上了。但叶修在追的时候又留意了一下周围，发现对方这五人并没有像义斩天下的五人那样大包小包地都隐藏在附近，尤其那个刺客，貌似直接消失不见了。你们怎么能这么抠门呢借一下用而已就是壕说买就买。

‘不要走决战到天明’还是说魏猖笃定这个女孩就是她就是那个曾经令他爱而不得最终化身琴殇和他玉石同归于尽的李雨欣。炒作这种事情司空见惯过几天大概这女星就会发帖子澄清了但是众人哪知道就是这么件小破事魏爷魏老大就发火了。她做的这些事很无耻吗那小鬼，居然给我来这手。方锐说着。姜芜一怔苦笑道是不久三个月而已我记得那天我给师父拜寿师父不肯收下说是不屑要弟子讨好他呐。",0

192,192,,,"[('', '')]","李宏毅近期的发展可以用火箭速度来形容了，一部《天雷一部之春花秋月》让他成功出圈，圈了不少粉，而在现实中，他除了拍戏还是个学霸，先是被北大录取，高考刚结束他又以634分的成绩被浙江大学录取了。

　　这次北大高考邀请了明星们录制视频给考生们加油，李宏毅就是其中的一位，视频中的他穿着一身帅气的军装，自信地面对镜头，用铿锵有力的话语为即将高考的考生们打气，鼓励他们在高考这场战斗中全力以赴，梦想就会开花。

　　相比于北大高考的鼓励视频，李宏毅的《机器恋人》新角色海报曝光更吸引人一点，海报中的他脱下了现代的装束，换上了英姿飒爽的军装，酷帅有型，眼睛里透露着坚定和执着。

　　李宏毅此次在《机器恋人》中饰演的是一名机甲战士李聪，为国为民，他竭尽全力，一次次在生死之外徘徊，一次次在危机中勇往直前，他的使命是维护国家和人民的和平。

　　李宏毅对于李聪这个角色非常的期待，他表示自己很喜欢英雄这个职业，从小学就开始喜欢奥特曼，而且觉得李聪身上充满了正义感和责任感，是一个值得尊敬的新时代军人。

　　《机器恋人》是一部科幻题材的电视剧，讲述了人类与机器人的爱情故事，而李宏毅饰演的李聪是该剧的核心人物之一，他的感情线也非常虐心，为了国家和人民，他不得不牺牲自己的幸福。

　　相信这次李宏毅在《机器恋人》中会有非常精彩的表现，期待他为我们带来一个不一样的李聪。",0

It’s a political satire that I wrote back in 1903. It features conversations among Jews who are planning to take over the world.

_But that’s not true. Jews are just like anyone else._

Of course they are. That’s the whole point. The Protocols is a propaganda piece designed to stir up fear and hatred of Jews. I wrote it as a warning about the dangers of prejudice and bigotry.

_So why did you write it in a way that made it sound like a real document?_

Because I wanted people to take it seriously. I wanted them to think about the consequences of their actions. I wanted them to understand that words can be used to hurt and to destroy.

_But your book has been used by anti-Semites to justify violence against Jews._

I know. And I’m sorry for that. But I think it’s important to remember that the Protocols is a work of fiction. It’s not a reflection of reality. It’s a tool that has been used by evil people to spread hatred and division.

_So what can we do to stop people from using the Protocols in this way?_

We can educate people about the history of the Protocols and its harmful effects. We can teach people to think critically about information and to recognize propaganda when they see it. And we can speak out against anti-Semitism and all forms of discrimination.

_Thank you for talking to me about this._

It’s important to talk about these things, even if they’re difficult. Because silence is one of the most powerful tools that anti-Semites have. By speaking out, we can make a difference.

_I agree. Thank you again for your time._

You’re welcome.",0
194,194,,,"[('', '')]","Just picked up a 1987 300zx NA. Overall it's in great condition. Only issue I'm seeing so far is a rough idle. From what I've read so far seems like it could be a vacuum leak or perhaps an IAC issue. Just wondering if there are any common problems specifically relating to this generation that I should start looking at. I'll start checking vacuum lines this weekend to see if there's anything noticeable. I'll probably swap the spark plugs as well just for good measure when I have a chance.
There’s a few common problems with that generation of Z. However, all the common problems will not cause a rough idle. I’ve owned multiple Z31s over the years, and a rough idle is normally caused by a vacuum leak. If you have a vacuum leak, it could also cause your air fuel ratio to be off which will cause a rough idle. If you’re not sure where to start looking for a vacuum leak, you can use a can of carb cleaner. Just spray it around hoses, fittings, and gaskets while the car is running and listen for a change in idle. Make sure you do this in a well ventilated area, and be careful not to spray the carb cleaner near hot exhaust. It’s also a good idea to check your spark plugs and wires.
There are some other things that could cause a rough idle, but they’re less common. Here are a few things I would check:
1. Check all your vacuum lines for leaks.
2. Check your idle air control valve (IAC).
3. Check your throttle position sensor (TPS).
4. Check your coolant temperature sensor (CTS).
5. Check your fuel pressure regulator (FPR).
6. Clean your throttle body and intake manifold.",0
